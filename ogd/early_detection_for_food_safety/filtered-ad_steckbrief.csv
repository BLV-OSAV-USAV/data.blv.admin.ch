1#F-2018-006#Food-borne viruses#Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.#Transmission in most cases through faecally contaminated water and food or through poor hygiene from person to person; important measures: Training of personnel who come into contact with food (producer, processor, cook, waiter) usually effective; sick personnel avoid food contact; thermal methods relatively efficient, even with complex matrix.#True#23.09.2018 00:00:00#10.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

2#F-2018-007#Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP)#Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a slow-growing bacterium and is the causative agent of Johne's disease (paratuberculosis) in cattle and other ruminants. The relationship between MAP and Crohn's disease is often studied in the literature. This disease is a chronic inflammation of the intestine. Although the link between MAP and Crohn's disease is not clear, it is recommended to minimise exposure to the bacteria. MAP can enter the environment through excreta from livestock, such as faeces, where the bacteria can persist. For example, MAP has been detected in water and soil from dairy producers, making contamination of vegetables possible. MAP has also been detected in the meat of cattle infected with Johne's disease. Despite hygienic work during milking, MAP can enter milk via udders, as the bacteria can be on the surface as well as inside the udders. Studies have shown that MAP can survive standard pasteurisation processes in milk. For example, MAP has been detected in commercially available pasteurised milk samples. Although many studies have not detected MAP in food, more positive results are expected as detection methods become more sensitive.#Old, controversial discussion that also led to discussions in Switzerland as early as 2007 (see Feller et al. 2007) At that time, a connection could neither be proven nor negated. It still remains unclear whether and to what extent MAP are responsible for Crohn's disease. If MAP - due to new methods - are now increasingly detected in past or high-paste milk, these questions arise. These questions arise again when MAP is increasingly detected in past or high-paste milk.#True#17.05.2018 00:00:00#09.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

3#F-2018-008#ß-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA)#β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a non-protreinogenic amino acid and is produced by various free-living or symbiotic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). It can also be produced by eukaryotic phytoplankton such as Diatoma and dinoflagellates. BMAA is a neurotoxin and has been linked in the literature to neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amytrophic lateral sclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease, but the connection is not yet clear. The neurotoxin is ingested through the consumption of contaminated water, crustaceans, shellfish, fish and algae-based food supplements. The greatest concentrations of BMAA are present during the bloom periods, but accumulations can also occur in the tissues of seafood and fish, which means that BMAA can be ingested throughout the year.#Relatively new topic, only few research results; connection between BMAA and neurodegenerative diseases unclear; BMAA has been detected in ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients; bound BMAA neglected until now, concentrations and influence unknown.Update 07.02.2022 (Focus, 04.02.2022 Mysterious Canada disease: cover-up attempts fuel a suspicion - FOCUS Online): A new type of nerve disease is going around in New Brunswick, Canada. Possible cause: lobster, which many of those affected had previously eaten. But the provincial government seems to want to nip such reports in the bud. Instead, they seem more concerned with correcting existing case numbers downwards. At the end of April, the nerve toxin BMAA was suspected for the first time. The neurotoxin can occur in shellfish such as lobsters. Lobster fishing is New Brunswick's main source of income besides tourism. 91 percent of those affected said they had eaten lobster before the outbreak of the disease.#True#08.04.2018 00:00:00#10.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

4#F-2018-020#Anthraquinone in foods#The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) carried out an expert opinion on anthraquinone in food on behalf of bio Suisse. The study was published in February 2017. The reason for this was the finding that residues were detected in various organic and conventional products in recent years. Anthraquinone acts as a repellent against birds and was therefore previously used to dress seeds. It is therefore considered a pesticide. In the EU, however, its use has been forbidden for several years now because of health concerns. An analysis by the BNN (Bundesverband Naturkost Naturwaren), the Association of Organic Processors, Wholesalers and Retailers, of several thousand datasets showed that smoked products in particular have a significant increase in anthraquinone content and that there are no differences between organic and conventional products. The authors assume that drying or roasting processes promote the occurrence of anthraquinones. It is further assumed that drying and possibly smoking processes are the main contributors to anthraquinone residues. The EFSA concludes in its expert opinion on anthraquinone as an active substance in plant protection products that carcinogenic effects related to anthraquinone cannot be ruled out and that the risk potential in mammals cannot be explicitly determined. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the substance as a possible carcinogen for humans ("Group 2B").#The origin of anthraquinones (AC) is unknown (only assumptions); carcinogenicity not yet confirmed but correlations exist; anthraquinone is ubiquitous in the environment and has also been detected in the air; study showed that AC decreases during tea production#True#17.05.2018 00:00:00#11.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

5#F-2018-021#Blockchain in the food industry#Blockchain technology is currently best known in relation to cryptocurrencies, which are based on the blockchain concept. However, this technology is not only applicable in the financial industry, but also in almost all other economic sectors and administrations, including the food industry. Blockchain works with decentrally stored data blocks and are also referred to as "distributed ledger" technology, i.e. decentralised ledger technology (DLT). Data records are verifiable and almost impossible to manipulate as a result of decentralised storage, which is an advantage. Some companies have already started to use blockchain. For example, Walmart, IBM, the Chinese retailer JD.com, and Tsinghua University founded a "Blockchain Food Safety Alliance" to improve the traceability and safety of food. Initial trials were undertaken by the FSA (UK). Blockchain could be used to enhance traceability and reduce food-fraud by recording validated information concerning the origin and the state of the food. On one hand, all parties in the value-added chain (farmers, suppliers, processors, distributors, retailers, consumers and regulators) can access real-time information about food products (e.g., to trace contaminated goods back to its source, verify that food is produced without child labour, etc.). On the other hand, users will be able to trace-back the entire product lifecycle from farm to retailer. A test by Walmart showed that to trace mangoes took six days before using blockchain and 2.2 seconds when using blockchain. The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations also recommends the use of blockchain technology as a vital e-agriculture infrastructure component for building innovative food systems, and for increasing food safety, security and market efficiency. To counterweigh the enthusiam, there are critical opinions voiced against the technology. As an example, see this article by Jessica McKenzie (2018).#In this context, blockchain technology ought to be used to improve and accelerate the traceability of food. As with any form of data documentation, there is a risk that data will be manipulated to prevent exact traceability. Apparently, however, blockchain technology seems to be particularly immune to data manipulation.#True#13.10.2018 00:00:00#16.08.2023 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

6#F-2018-022#Echinococcus multilocularis#E. multilocularis is ranked 7th in terms of public health consequences for France by Anses (French Agency for Food, Environment, Health and Safety at Work). The assessment is based on an incidence score of 1 (low) combined with a disease severity of 4 (very high): Between 2013 and 2015, 29 cases occurred in France, with a noticeable increase in cases in the regions along the Swiss border (Grand Est; Bourgogne-Franche-Comté and Auvergene-Rhône-Alpes). Positive findings in foxes are also found in the areas mentioned.In Germany, a national database for alveolar echinococcosis is being established. Further information and assessment of the risk can be found in the dissertation by Schmidberger J. (2017). The main endemic area in Germany is in Baden-Würtemberg and Bavaria.The prevalence estimate for Germany in the period from 1992 to 2016 was 0.64 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, for Baden-Württemberg the estimated prevalence in the same period was 2.18 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and in Bavaria 1.48 cases per 100,000 inhabitants were observed in this period.#Since 1999, there has been no obligation to report the occurrence of Echinococcus spp. in humans. However, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) has figures on how many people are hospitalised for the first time each year due to alveolar echinococcosis. The most recent figures are from 2016. The number of people hospitalised has tended to increase over the last few years: from 25 people in 2008 to 51 in 2016. This corresponds to an increase in the first hospitalisation rate from 0.22 to 0.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Further information can be found in the FSVO report on the surveillance of zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks (data 2017).#True#19.05.2018 00:00:00#28.08.2025 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

7#F-2018-023#Microbiological safety: convenience products (produce)#`Convenience (ready-to-eat) products are very popular. These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production? Is it a question of cross-contamination in production, in households?`#Households will become smaller in the future; the trend towards convenience products is likely to continue and increase in the future; raw foods and smoothies are a (growing) consumer need; the preparation instructions on the packaging primarily serve to prepare the products into enjoyable foods, only secondarily are potential contaminants also sustainably inactivated.#True#06.09.2018 00:00:00#26.04.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

8#F-2018-024#Microplastics#Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.#`Microplastics have been detected in various salts and waters (China, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea); highest concentrations tend to be found in sea salt, but also in salt lakes or rock salt; it is assumed that microplastics can also be distributed via the air; impact of microplastics on the human organism has not yet been researched, but it has been proven that microplastics can accumulate in the tissue of marine animals. A controversial topic, with two sub-areas to be distinguished: a) added microplastics (particle size ≤ 5mm) in products such as cosmetics and b) contamination from the environment. In connection with microplastics, not only the plastic per se is to be seen, but also additives such as plasticisers as well as adsorbed organic compounds. Rubber tyres (abrasion) and clothing made of synthetic fibres (loss during washing) are also named as sources of microplastics. Microplastics are thus also an issue for foodstuffs other than those with a connection to the seas, such as salt, fish and shellfish.CUSP (European Research Cluster to Understand the Health Impact of MNP), a cluster of 5 research projects under Horizon 2020, was launched in June 2021. These 5 projects were selected, which were submitted in the framework of this call for micro- and nanoplastics.

9#F-2018-025#Organosilicone surfactants#Organosilicone surfactants (OSS) adjuvants are silicone-based copolymers with super –penetrating, -spreading and –wetting properties to potentiate the active ingredient against plant and animal pests and diseases. Over 700’000 tons of OSS are produced globally per year out of over 4.5 million tons of total of organosilicon production making this class of formulants the most widely used amongst all high-production chemicals for pollution worldwide. The metabolism and fate of OSS are almost unstudied on published literature. Toxic effects from OSS are observed in honeybees. Several recently published peer-reviewed journals on this topic highlight the safety concerns of organosilicone surfactant on humans and animals.#Enhancers are classified as biologically inert and GRAS (generally recognised as safe), which is why they are not regulated; OSS have a negative impact on bees and other insects, which is why the question of the impact on humans arises; it is possible that the toxicity and uptake of OSS is dependent on the degree of polymerisation (molecular weight) and structure; light molecules are particularly affected; The FSVO has carried out a preliminary study on co-formulants (which also include OSS). It did not include certain substances and exclude others, but identified co-formulants which are applied in significant quantities and which could potentially lead to residues in/on food. For this purpose, the composition and sales figures for 2015 of the plant protection products (PPPs) authorised in Switzerland were examined. In principle, OSS could also be recorded in this way. The results show, however, that OSS do not belong to the quantitatively significant and potentially residue-relevant co-formulants of PPPs.OSS can not only be added to a PPP as a co-formulant, but they can also be marketed and used as separate products (wetting and adhesive agents). Wetting and adhesive agents are added separately to the spray mixture of PPP and water. Wetting agents and adhesives approved in Switzerland are published, by the FOAG, including some that contain polyethermodified trisiloxane (an OSS). Wetting and bonding agents were not considered in the preliminary study. Sales figures for wetting agents and adhesives are not available to the FSVO. Agroscope has made an estimate for OSS based on PPPs containing polyethermodified trisiloxane. This rough estimate shows that approximately 0.7 tonnes per year of polyethermodified trisiloxane are applied via PPPs.Plant protection products (PPPs) consist of one or more active substances and several co-formulants. However, only the food residues of the active substances and their metabolites are regulated. Co-formulants of PPPs are not assessed in a standard way. The Action Plan for Risk Reduction and Sustainable Use of PPPs therefore identifies a corresponding need for research.#True#19.12.2018 00:00:00#07.02.2023 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

11#F-2018-027#Vibrio spp. in seafood#V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.##True#20.12.2018 00:00:00#01.12.2023 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

12#F-2018-028#Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp.#Infections with Aspergillus spp. show a high morbidity and mortality rate in risk groups. Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance. Studies have shown that resistant Aspergillus spp. are also resistant to medicinal azoles, emerging from fungicides.#The risk group concerned is small; aspergilli not detected in cereal monitoring; resistant aspergilli detected from soil samples in greenhouses growing tomatoes, carrots, peppers (5.8% of samples). Propiconazole, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, epoxiconazole and bromuconazole are authorised in Switzerland.#True#08.04.2018 00:00:00#21.08.2025 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

13#F-2018-029#Cyclospora#Cyclospora infection is an intestinal disease caused by a unicellular parasite. Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected. The list of outbreaks is long and seems to have been increasing in recent years.#In 2018, EFSA issued an opinion assessing parasites in food and their importance regarding public health. Cyclospora does not rank among the prioritised topics of interest. In Havelaar et al. 2015, cyclospora is not included in the diability-adjusted-life-years (DALY) list; it is unclear whether this is due to a lack of data or it being a lower priority.#True#17.12.2018 00:00:00#09.10.2024 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

15#F-2021-032#Reducing joghurt sugar content with starter cultures#Reducing the sugar content in yoghurt is an urgent goal for nutrition science. Consumers are made aware of such products with the label 'reduced sugar'. There are great efforts to produce yoghurts with reduced sugar content, to reduce the added sugar (sucrose) and at the same time to maintain the sweetness of the product (and thus its acceptance by customers). Bacterial strains can be metabolically optimised in such a way that they excrete a sugar which then contributes to the sweetness of the yoghurt, but without this 'added sugar' having to be declared.#There is the possibility of deception. A yoghurt produced in this way could be offered as 'reduced sugar', as less sucrose is added, but still has the sweetness (the proportion of sugar) of a normal yoghurt, as the culture produces more galactose, quasi naturally. An application could also be lucrative from an economic point of view, as it would reduce costs for the ingredient sucrose.#True#11.12.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

23#F-2019-043#Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen#In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.#In Switzerland, studies have also been conducted; the presence of ST 131 was detected in vegetables and fish (Müller et al. 2016 ) and in surface waters (Zurfluh et al. 2013). The Emerging Risks Expert network EFSA classifies this topic as an "emerging issue" and encourages Member States to collect monitoring data. OneHealth issue, as the pathogen occurs along the entire chain. Other clones (e.g., ST1193) are already occurring in patients (Valenza et al. 2019).#True#30.01.2019 00:00:00#14.11.2024 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

24#F-2019-044#Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE, syn. FSME)#TBE or tick-borne encephalitis (encephalitis = inflammation of the brain) is an infectious disease caused by the TBE virus. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick (Castor bean tick). This is the most significant way of transmitting the virus. An alimentary transmission by unpasteurised milk, or milk products from acutely infected goats or cattle was reported on and has been discussed repeatedly in the past. In Germany, two outbreaks, caused by alimentary transmissions, were detected in 2016 and 2017 respectively. TBE is a viral infection caused by one in three tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis).#In summer 2016, a first outbreak was detected in Germany. Two cases occurred after the consumption of raw goat milk and raw goat milk cheese. In the goat herd, at least 9 out of 45 goats were infected with the TBE virus. The virus was detected in 5 out of 20 raw milk products, and in raw-milk soft and cream cheeses.In summer 2017, a second outbreak was detected. 13 cases due to the consumption of raw goat milk. People vaccinated against the TBE virus did not fall ill. When testing goats, goat milk and goat cheese, there was no proof of the presence of the TBE virus.#True#30.01.2019 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

27#F-2019-047#Dietary supplements#According to Menu CH, around 50% of Swiss people regularly consume food supplements containing vitamins, minerals, trace elements or other substances. The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed. Consumers do not necessarily consult a doctor or a poison control centre, and there is no nutrivigilance system in Switzerland.Legal framework Switzerland: Most important: General food law provisions on safety and protection against deception, VNem, Ordinance on Novel Food, certain plants and substances may not be used in food (VLpH and VZVM). No nutrivigilance system (unlike France), no notification legal framework EU: Largely non-harmonised. Certain countries have specific regulations (maximum quantities, plant lists), some notification, few countries with nutrivigilance systems.#Various reports in RASFF and HorizonScan confirm the problem described above. In recent years, several signs on food supplements have also been discussed in the EFSA's EREN network: e.g., green tea extracts, black cohosh, piperine, counterfeit food supplements with unauthorised pharmaceuticals via internet tradeEU: non-harmonised legislation#True#11.02.2019 00:00:00#21.03.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

28#F-2019-048#Newborns with malformed hands#Cases of babies born without hands seem to be increasing in France, Germany, and Switzerland. In France, babies without hands or arms have been born for several years in three nearby heavily agricultural areas. The Agence de Sécurité Sanitaire (ANSES) has been commissioned to find the cause of this phenomenon by a committee of experts (comité d'experts scientifiques "CES"). Suspicion falls on pesticides or fertilisers as the reason for the malformations, but CES speaks of no unusual accumulation of incidents: "Since no risk factors for ATMS ('agénésie transverse des membres supérieurs') have been identified and since these malformations are rare, the expert commission (CES) does not yet recommend conducting a large-scale epidemiological investigation that would have to be observed for several decades. However, CES believes that knowledge of the environmental causes of developmental anomalies is currently insufficient and recommends strengthening research capacity in this area." (ANSES, 2019). Studies are complicated by the frequent lack of a reporting registry of birth deformities, as well as the interaction of a wide variety of influences, such as living conditions, nutrition, medications, environmental factors, etc., that can lead to the development of a child with a developmental anomaly.#A report has been published by Santé Public France and Anses on the high incidence of hand malformations in babies in three regions of France. The causes could not be identified, but some recommendations were made.It remains to be seen whether the malformations are indeed a statistical coincidence. Currently, the classification system for medical diagnoses (ICD) uses a non-specific code for hand malformations. Thus, the absence of a finger, several fingers as well as an entire hand is coded under one digit. This means that the ICD is not suitable for recording and analysing hand malformations. For targeted research into the causes of congenital malformations, there would need to be mandatory reporting nationwide and a central, nationwide malformation register. In addition, hand malformations would have to be coded according to the internationally recognised Oberg-Manske-Tonkin classification. Malformations at the age of one to two years would have to be diagnosed by an experienced hand surgeon and human geneticist, followed by an epidemiological analysis of the frequencies and an investigation of possible triggers (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Handchirurgie).#True#11.11.2019 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

They are rich in protein, high in omega-3 fatty acids and contain essential vitamins and minerals. They could one day replace meat and fish. Currently, chlorella and spirulina are the main food supplements on the market.#Research into the production of microalgae for human nutrition is being carried out in various institutions in Switzerland. Individual start-ups are already producing microalgae, mainly as food supplements, but the price per kilogram is still quite high, which means that their use in other foods does not yet make much sense.#True#22.02.2019 00:00:00#14.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

31#F-2019-051#Campylobacter - roles of flies in transmission#Campylobateriosis is the most common food-associated disease, not only in Switzerland but worldwide. The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis. When temperatures rise, the number of flies increases and the incidence of campylobacteriosis rises at the same rate.#The scenario described by the Canadian authors seems plausible.#True#25.02.2019 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#70#`--- Primary ---

32#F-2019-052#Bovine meat and milk factors (BMMF)#There are reports in the media about a new, possibly infection-causing structure, called BMMF (ring-shaped genetic elements, similar to the plasmids of bacteria). However, the nature of the postulated pathogens, which lie between viruses and bacteria, does not seem to be clear yet. The German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) reports: the distribution pattern of new colorectal and breast cancer cases observed worldwide suggests a close connection between the consumption of milk and meat products from European cattle (Bos taurus).The hypothesis is: an infection with a previously unknown pathogen transmitted by consuming dairy products and/or beef occurs in early infancy. The pathogens induce a chronic inflammatory reaction in certain tissues (intestine, breast), which can promote the development of cancer in the surrounding tissue. The outbreak of the disease occurs decades after the infection! Possible causative agents could be the BMMFs, single-stranded ring-shaped DNA elements that show great similarity to sequences of specific bacterial plasmids. Most BMMFs show similarity to plasmids of Acinetobacter baumannii. Some BMMFs also show similarities to certain viruses with small, circular, single-stranded DNA genomes. The nature of these pathogens has not yet been clearly defined. They represent a new class of pathogens that are, in their characteristics, between viruses and bacteria. Therefore, in view of the relationship to plasmids, the name "plasmidomes" was chosen for this previously unknown class of pathogens.#A study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published in 2015 that the consumption of red meat can probably increase the risk of cancer ('probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)'; press release 2015). In its 2014 report on this topic, the Federal Commission on Nutrition (FCN) concluded: "The evidence from cohort studies summarised here suggests that long-term adverse health effects on mortality, cardiovascular disease, certain forms of cancer such as colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes must be assumed for red meat and especially for meat products (processed meat). In contrast, however, five new systematic reviews suggest that most people can continue to eat red and processed meat as they do now. The large studies found that cuts have little effect on health. Whether red meat actually has negative long-term effects and what role BMMFs may play in this remains unclear until more research is presented.#True#27.02.2019 00:00:00#29.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

33#F-2018-053#EHEC: continuous increase in lab reports#In 2017, a total of 696 VTEC cases confirmed by laboratory diagnostics were reported to the FOPH (463 in the previous year). This is once again an increase of 50% compared to the previous year. The rate resulting from 8.2 new cases reported per 100,000 inhabitants is the highest rate since the obligation to report was introduced in 1999. As in the previous year, most cases were registered in the third quarter. The age group of children under 5 years continued to show the highest rate of 16.0 per 100,000 inhabitants reported and accounted for 10% of reported VTEC cases. (source: Zoonosis Report 2018). This increase was already discussed in 2015, and at that time, this was attributed to the spread of new diagnostic methods (FOPH, 2015). New investigations by Swiss TPH show that the increase in case numbers are partially due to new analytics, but not exclusively. A seperate investigation is underway and about to be completed. It concludes that there is a real increase.#JEMRA (2018) estimates that in the WHO European region (EUR A) [1], approximately 60% of infections can be attributed to food; the remaining infections occur through direct contact (person-to-person), contact with animals, contact with water and soil. [1] Countries in EUR A, this also includes Switzerland.ECDC (08.02.2024) For 2022, 29 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries reported 8 565 confirmed cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection. The overall EU/EEA notification rate was 2.5 cases per 100 000 population, which exceeded the prepandemic level and represented a 25% increase compared to the notification rate in 2021. The STEC notification rate was highest in children under five years of age with 12.1 cases per 100 000 population for males and 11.3 cases per 100 000 population for females. The confirmed haemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) cases increased in 2022 after a stable trend of reported cases before and during the pandemic years in the EU/EEA. Among the 568 HUS cases reported, the majority were in the youngest age groups, from 0–4 years (60%) to 5–14 years (24%). However, the majority of the deceased cases with HUS were over 60 years old.#True#11.12.2018 00:00:00#11.08.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

34#F-2018-054#Mycotoxins in foods#Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).#The Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey Report for 2018 provides a global overview and complements the findings above. In addition, "emerging mycotoxins" such as aurofusarin, moniliformin and enniatin are found increasingly.#True#11.12.2018 00:00:00#09.08.2023 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

35#F-2019-055#Nanoparticles in foods#Nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the food industry to modulate various aspects of food. As a result, man-made nanoparticles are increasingly being used as functional ingredients in foods and beverages. They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed. One study shows how nanoparticles can positively influence bacteria of the digestive tract. They speak of "probiotic nanoparticles". Nanoparticles are also already being used in pharmacy, for example to precisely transport substances to where they are needed.#In the field of nanoparticles in foods, there are risks and new possibilities alike.#True#09.10.2019 00:00:00#16.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

36#F-2019-056#Climate change and its impact on food safety#Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.#Various publications have shown that climate change has a direct impact, e.g., on the number of salmonella cases; in addition, there are indirect consequences, such as the occurrence of vectors at higher altitudes (e.g. TBE), effects on crop irrigation, etc.#True#05.03.2019 00:00:00#20.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

42#F-2019-062#Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis#In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.#In its 2018 annual report, the ANSES (French Agency for Food, Environment and Occupational Safety) states that the Bacillus cereus group, known for its impact on a wide range of human diseases, is the second most common cause for collective food poisoning in France. Against this backdrop, in 2018, a project was carried out to assess the potential implications of Bacillus thuringiensis strains and commercial strains in the occurrence of foodborne diseases. The study found that Bacillus thuringiensis was present in more than 20% of foodborne disease outbreaks analysed from 2007 to 2017, and that in 90% of the cases certain commercial Bacillus thuringiensis was involved. A second project will begin in 2019, to complete this study and assess the virulence of the strains. Updates will follow...#True#30.06.2019 00:00:00#06.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

43#F-2019-063#Hepatitis E virus (HEV)#Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important human infection in the EU/EEA countries and, according to EFSA, more than 21,000 acute clinical cases with 28 deaths have been reported in the last 10 years, with a tenfold increase in the total number of HEV cases reported; the majority (80%) of cases were reported in France, Germany and the UK. However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy. HEV can also enter food through faecal contamination. Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been identified in immunocompetent individuals as well as in recognised risk groups, such as those with pre-existing liver damage, immunosuppressive diseases or immunosuppressive treatments.#Fact sheet on Hepatits E by the FOPH.

44#F-2019-064#Microbiological safety of whey powder#Whey powder is a by-product of the cheese production and is obtained from dried whey. It consists mainly of approx. 85% lactose and approx. 13% protein. In the past, an increasing number of foods were withdrawn from the market because whey powder contaminated with Salmonella was processed in the products. Whey powder is increasingly processed in the food industry as an additional source of protein and added to many different food products. The hygiene regulation stipulates that Salmonella must not be detectable in 25g of whey powder. In addition, process hygiene criteria for whey powder (including Enterobacteriaceae) are defined. But "this criterion does not apply to products in the food industry, intended for further processing." The extent to which pathogenic E. coli can be introduced to food by whey powder has not yet been well described.#Whey powder is a product that is added to many foods. It is a critical key ingredient meaning that if contamination (chemical or microbiological) occurs in whey powder, many downstream products could be affected.#True#15.04.2019 00:00:00#22.08.2025 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

46#F-2019-076#Listeria innocua#Listeria innocua is commonly described as a non-pathogenic Listeria species. However, recent studies now show that various genetic elements are present that confer the characteristics of a pathogenic strain to L. innocua. In vitro and in vivo assays have shown that atypical haemolytic L. innocua is virulent, can actively cross the intestinal epithelium and can spread systemically to the liver and spleen, albeit to a lesser extent than the reference strain L. monocytogenes EGDe .#The pathogenicity of L. innocua appears to be much lower than that of Listeria monocytogenes. Although human exposure to haemolytic L. innocua is probably rare, these findings are important for food safety and public health.#True#04.08.2022 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

The sweetener sucralose (E955) was internationally deemed as safe within the framework of the authorisation of additives and will be re-evaluated by the EFSA by the end of 2020 at the latest. The current state of knowledge (see BfR 2019) on the stability of sucralose and the decomposition products formed during heating should be taken into account. There are still many data gaps on the identity and concentration concerning these substances and the exposure estimation, and the BfR ( German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) was not able to make a conclusive risk assessment in its statement (2019). The question arises whether measures should be taken in the meantime.#Based on our own observations, we found that sucralose can also degrade autocatalytically (combustion with HCl emission) at room temperature (see figure in 'documents').#True#11.04.2019 00:00:00#20.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

48#F-2019-078#Antimicrobial resistance in plant-based foods#Antibiotics are essential drugs. They are used to treat diseases caused by bacteria. However, antibiotics increasingly lose their efficacy because bacteria are becoming resistant. In recent years, antibiotics have become less effective. In order to ensure their efficacy in the long run and to stem the spread of resistant bacteria, the Federal Council has adopted the comprehensive Strategy on Antibiotic Resistance (StAR), which is now being implemented in various fields. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens can also be found in foods. They can lead to increased resistance in humans. Resistance can be enhanced not only through animal products but also plant-based products. However, we have far less information on plant-based products than on animal food products. Salads are popular foods in a balanced and healthy diet. They are often sold in a ready-tp-eat packging (plastic wrapping). It is known that such fresh products can be contaminated with hygiene-relevant germs. Different research groups have shown that these products contain germs that are resistant to antibiotics.#The Swiss Antibiotic Resistance Report 2018 does not contain any results on the significance of plant-based foods and antibiotic resistance. However, various publications show that antibiotic resistance occurs in plant-based ready-to-eat foods. Genes conferring resistance to antimicrobial agents, including resistance to drugs used to treat human and animal infections, are found in bacteria isolated from foods of plant origin. Soil, water, insects, plant disease treatments, and fertilisers are common sources of contamination. How and to which extend the antimicrobail use in crop production is chosen for the emergence and maintenance of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms is unclear.#True#01.04.2019 00:00:00#02.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

49#F-2019-081#Pyrrolizidine alkaloids#Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) are natural constituents that have been identified in more than 350 plant species worldwide and are suspected in more than 6,000. Plants produce them as defensive substances against predators. Of more than 660 known PAs and similar compounds, the 1,2-unsaturated PAs in particular have a potential to be harmful to health. They are therefore undesirable in feed and food. In food, PAs can occur above all in tea, honey, dried herbs and spices. Studies have shown that pollen products sold as food supplements (NEM) and used in apitherapy may also contain toxic PAs.#In animal experiments, certain pyrrolizidine alkaloids show liver-toxic as well as carcinogenic and mutagenic effects.#True#28.10.2019 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

51#F-2019-083#Surrogate meat and meat alternatives#The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.#Even traditional meat producers are starting to invest in alternative meat products, be it plant-based products that imitate meat or meat-based products based from cell cultures. Besides meat, work is also being done on other plant-based products, such as alternative products for cheese but also eggs.TA-SWISS has launched a project to investigate this issue further in 2022. Results to be awaited.#True#18.04.2019 00:00:00#01.08.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

52#F-2019-088#Poppy seeds#Poppy seeds for edible purposes are the ripe seeds of Papaver somniferum L. (opium poppy). They are mainly used for the production of baked goods containing poppy seeds. The seeds of blue, grey or white poppies are used, for example, to sprinkle the surface of bread, rolls or snacks. In ground form, they are used to make poppy seed masses for filling poppy seed cakes, etc. Studies showed that poppy seeds may have higher levels of morphine. According to previous findings, the morphine content in edible poppies seems to depend mainly on the poppy variety and the respective harvesting methods (LAVES). In France, cases of poisoning with bakery products containing poppy seeds became public.#The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has carried out a health assessment of the morphine content in poppy seeds. In this assessment, a provisional maximum daily intake of 6.3 µg morphine/kg body weight/day is given. For an adult with a body weight of 60 kg, this results in a provisional maximum daily intake of 0.38 mg morphine. From this, a provisional guideline value of 4 mg/kg poppy seed was derived. For children, too, no adverse effects are to be expected if this provisional guideline value is followed.#True#11.07.2019 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

53#F-2019-090#Aquaculture#The significance of aquaculture has grown rapidly in recent decades. Further opportunities to use the world's oceans for food security are underway. However, this also entails risks that can affect food safety. On Lofoten, for example, millions of salmon fell victim to an algal bloom in May 2019, which led to the death of the animals.#Global warming (deadly algal blooms), overuse of antibiotics, dependence on wild stocks for feed, diseases in livestock, and poor management threaten this lucrative and fast-growing sector. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of food production, and since 2013 aquaculture production has surpassed that of wild fisheries. New and disruptive technologies will increasingly provide new opportunities to improve production, profitability, and sustainability of global fish farming. These technologies include, but are not limited to, genomic selection (GS), genome editing (GE), information/digital technology, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and renewable energy, offshore farming, oral vaccines, novel marketing strategies with blockchain, and the integration of different areas of aquaculture with the Internet of Things (IOT).

57#F-2019-096#Curcuma#Recently, there have been an increasing number of reports on 'curcuma' food supplements (NEM) and possible hepatotoxicity.Some of these are food supplements (NEM) with Curcuma longa extracts, i.e. almost pure curcumin, as well as turmeric in combination with other botanicals such as piperine (the flavour carrier of black pepper). The cases were reported via the French (ANSES) and Italian nutrivigilance system, among others. The FSVO has only very scanty information on the cases. The reason for this is the lack of information on detailed product compositions, dosages, case histories of the consumers including their state of health, other food supplements, medicinal products, etc., which makes the suspected cases difficult to classify and hardly to consider as scientifically proven causal relationships.Regarding piperine in food supplements, the BfR writes:' Piperine is added to some food supplements and is supposed to make the ingredients more available, among other things. Those who use such products take in piperine - in contrast to the normal diet - in isolation at once (as a 'bolus') and without the simultaneous intake of other pepper ingredients. The BfR has assessed the health risks of bolus administration with isolated piperine - and recommends: Adults should not take more than 2 milligrams of isolated piperine per day via food supplements. For pregnant women, the BfR advises against the use of such supplements'.In connection with turmeric, there are also frequent reports of food fraud, which can lead to dangerous levels of lead in turmeric powders, for example. The elevated levels can often be attributed to bleaching agents, which are supposed to give the powder its bright orange colour.#According to Tox Info Suisse, around 24 enquiries have been received there since 1995, but never because of hepatotoxicity. Tox Info Suisse considers this topic to be of minor importance.#True#23.07.2019 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

58#F-2021-097#Food platforms and delivery services#What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a packaging-free delivery service as soon as autumn 2019.#According to media statements, the growth rates for home deliveries are in the double digits. But what about food safety? Such offers are, just like the online food trade, very difficult to vet. There is a potential risk for consumers. The question is to what extent should such delivery services be regulated.#True#25.06.2021 00:00:00#21.08.2023 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

59#F-2019-098#Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) (e.g Vertical Farming)#A new trend is spreading. Salads and herbs are growing directly in retail shops. Young plants are grown hors-sol in illuminated display cases. The customer harvests them himself. The concept of underground farming goes even further. Here, fish and vegetables are grown in underground, disused caverns, tunnels and underground shafts in a circular economy. This concept also aims to use less water and fewer pesticides. The first underground farm is already growing and selling salads in London.Vertical farming can play an important role in reducing emissions from the agricultural sector while providing affordable and abundant food to consumers. Vertical farming can produce high crop yield.Artificial grow lights, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent grow lights, are commonly used in modern day indoor farming, citing advantages in energy efficiency and a higher controlled environment. However, the use of LEDs poses a risk in mercury contaminations as a result of its production process, specifically LEDs with polyurethane encapsulates that were traditionally produced using mercury resins as a catalyst. The investigation found high concentrations of mercury in the LED encapsulant, and the encapsulant material was identified to be polyurethane, indicating the source of mercury contamination to be the LED polyurethane encapsulant.#This way of producing herbs and salads is not entirely new, but is now practised directly in shops. This eliminates several steps in the production chain. It remains to be seen how customers will accept the offer. The question remains whether pesticides can also be dispensed with in the medium and long term, and whether microbiological contaminants (e.g. STEC) can thus no longer be found in such products. The combination of vertical farming and underground farming is practically obvious, especially by using the waste heat from data storage facilities in the mountain for agricultural production.#True#12.07.2019 00:00:00#15.04.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

60#F-2019-099#Pet food (Salmonella, Listeria)#Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) Salmonella serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with Salmonella are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).#Analysis of 51 raw feed samples carried out at the University of Zurich. Conclusion: Enterobacteriaceae in 73% of the samples, ESBL enzyme-forming bacteria in 61% of the samples, Salmonella in 2 samples, colistin-resistant E. coli in 2 samples.In the USA, epidemiological investigations identified pet food as the cause of infections in humans. However, it remains unclear how the infection occurred.Like EU law, the VTNP requires manufacturers to monitor for salmonella (with "zero tolerance") on "finished pet food" (this does not apply to other feeds: there, the veterinary requirements for salmonella monitoring only extend to the "processing of components of animal origin" stage, e.g., fish meal, insect meal, etc.). Manufacturers of pet food (incl. chewing toys) require a permit from the cantonal veterinarian in accordance with Art. 11 VTNP. The veterinary offices must also check the HACCP concept (incl. implementation of on-farm monitoring for Salmonella spp.) (maximum annual inspection interval). Small hobby producers" could be problematic. The official feed control of Agroscope controls the pet food businesses - whether official samples of chewing articles are also tested for salmonella in this context is currently not known. The "handling of the salmonella issue" within the framework of feed law is classified as relevant and Agroscope is preparing a guideline on this. It should be noted that the responsibility for controlling and managing the "salmonella risk" lies with the farms.#True#05.08.2019 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

62#F-2019-101#Chronic wasting disease#Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion-related transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids, including deer, elk, reindeer and sika deer. CWD has been confirmed in at least 26 US states, three Canadian provinces, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The number of cases has been increasing for the past 5 years. US scientists assume a possible risk of infection for humans, by analogy with BSE. They conclude that the available data suggest that the incidence of CWD in cervids is increasing and that there is potential for transmission to humans and subsequent human disease. Given the long incubation period of prion-associated diseases, consideration should be given to improving public health measures to prevent human exposure to CWD prions and thus reduce the potential risk to humans. This would reduce the likelihood of a BSE-like event in the coming years.#Cases of CWD have already occurred in Europe. For example, in Finland, Norway and Sweden.#True#07.08.2022 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

64#F-2019-103#Milk substitutes made from cashews#Vegan nutrition is in vogue. Companies are responding by creating new milk substitutes, including cashew nut-based ones. In Switzerland, cheese has been made from cashew nuts since 2015. 50 to 60 tonnes of organic cashews are imported from Vietnam every year. The cashew milk is processed raw and not pasteurised, only the "ricotta" and the products sold in the retail trade are thermised at 65 degrees to make them last longer. The concern here is that products are not necessarily pasteurised, especially as nuts can be contaminated by micro-organisms and/or pesticides. In many countries, nuts are harvested by hand and dried in the sun. Contamination can occur through insects, birds, rodents, but also through air and soil. Wet, humid conditions also pose a significant risk for the formation of aflatoxins.

68#F-2019-107#Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)#Succinate dehydrogenases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in cellular respiration in a variety of organisms, including humans. Blocking this essential cellular function with inhibitors called succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) is the basis for the efficacy of this class of substances used as fungicides. Examples of SDIs are isoflucypram or boscalid. Several scientists have formulated the hypothesis in a recent press article that there may be health risks associated with the use of SDHIs in agriculture. So far, little is known concretely about possible effects on the respiratory chain in humans. ANSES published a first report in January 2019.#This is primarily a question of health and safety.#True#05.12.2019 00:00:00#14.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

71#F-2019-110#Nipah Virus (NiV)#The Nipah virus (NiV) can cause an often severe infection in humans and pigs. In rarer cases, infections in dogs, cats, ruminants or horses have also been detected. Guinea pigs and hamsters are also experimentally infectable. Reservoir hosts are fruit-eating fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, from which it can be passed on to other animals and humans. Infected animals and patients excrete the virus with respiratory secretions, saliva and urine. Contact with respiratory secretions is considered the main route of transmission in nosocomial infection. In the first NiV outbreak in 1998/99 in Malaysia and Singapore, transmission from fruit bats occurred via excreta or infected fruit ingested by pigs. Transmission from infected pigs to humans (285 infections with 105 deaths) occurred through direct contact with infected animals and their secretions (saliva, urine, blood). The virus can also be transmitted between humans.an approved vaccine or therapy to protect potentially exposed or infected humans or animals is not yet available.##True#20.10.2019 00:00:00#14.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

73#F-2019-112#Aeromonas spp.#Aeromonas spp., such as A. hydrophila, are bacteria that can form cell-damaging toxins. They are widespread in nature and are found mainly in surface waters (lakes, rivers), hence the term 'water germs'. The bacteria have been detected in fish, but also in insects and domestic and farm animals, and can cause gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans. A. hydrophila is already known to be a pathogen in fish and seafood; the germ can also be detected in the meat of livestock, in vegetables and dairy products.##True#17.10.2019 00:00:00#25.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

74#F-2019-113#Plastic rice#Despite little evidence of a widespread problem, there are rumours that 'plastic rice' is being sold in Africa and elsewhere. These rumours have probably arisen because of reports of rice being adulterated elsewhere. In one case, ordinary but edible rice was passed off as premium 'wuchang' grains. Then in 2011, reports emerged that rice was made with potatoes and an industrial sticky resin. Reports of Chinese plastic rice flooding the market and endangering consumers spread worldwide, but at no time were there confirmed cases of large quantities of plastic being passed off as rice. The existence of plastic rice is especially unlikely, as plastic is usually more expensive than rice. However, there could be another scam: one source reports that plastic rice is possibly rice that has been stored for up to 10 years and not ideally. The rice becomes contaminated with mould and takes on a green colour. Fraudsters bleach it and cover it with a layer of wax to give it a shiny white colour.#Plastic rice has largely been debunked as a myth, but uncertainty remains in parts of the population. Rice made entirely of plastic is an unlikely threat, but food fraud remains a risk.#True#28.10.2019 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

75#F-2019-115#Cyanobacteria#Cyanobacteria are microorganisms found mainly in eutrophic freshwaters, i.e. waters enriched with nutrients. While the impact of climate change has an impact on the spread of cyanobacteria, human activity, both urban and rural (fertiliser runoff, sewage, etc.) is also crucial. Cyanobacteria can release toxins some of which are very dangerous to humans. The main circumstances and routes of exposure to these toxins are ingestion of contaminated water, inhalation, or skin contact during recreational water activities (swimming, water sports). Consumption of fruits or vegetables irrigated with contaminated water or consumption of fish and shellfish can also be a source of exposure to cyanotoxins. The effects of cyanotoxins on human health are varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are most commonly reported, but eye or skin damage (irritation and rash), myalgia, liver and kidney damage are also often described. On the other hand, the involvement of these toxins in the development of chronic diseases, especially neurological diseases, remains the subject of scientific controversy.#`
It is questionable whether and to what extent cyanotoxins pose a risk to algae-based food supplements. It is also unclear to what extent toxins can be transferred to food products (e.g., vegetables, fruits) through irrigation. In France, regulations have been issued for drinking water and recreational activities. The concentration limits for acceptable cyanobacteria and/or cyanotoxins are set by different recommendations or regulations depending on the use.

76#F-2019-116#Candida auris#Candida auris is a drug-resistant fungal species that was first isolated from a human ear in 2009, and was therefore named 'auris' (lat. auris = ear). Since then, C. auris has been associated with human diseases in many countries. Not only is it remarkable that C. auris show no susceptibility to antifungal agents, but also that pathogenic isolates seem to have arisen independently and simultaneously on three continents. The widespread use of fungicides is considered to be one of the causes for the emergence of C. auris. While selection through the use of azoles may certainly have contributed to drug resistance in this fungal species, it does not readily explain why this organism suddenly became a human pathogen on three continents. The first major C. auris outbreak in Europe resulted in 72 cases in a London hospital in 2015-16. The US has recorded at least 799 infections in total, as of 11/09/2019.##True#21.10.2019 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

79#F-2019-119#Arcobacter spp. in foods and water#Arcobacter butzleri, recently renamed Aliarcobacter butzleri comb. nov., are aerotolerant Campylobacter-like organisms previously classified as Campylobacter. The genus Arcobacter was described in 1992. A. butzleri is found in environmental samples and untreated water appears to be a potential source of infection. In industrialised countries, the most important source of human contamination is food. Indeed, A. butzleri has been isolated in several farmed animals and is found in a variety of retail meats, including chicken, beef, pork, and lamb, with a high prevalence in poultry. Milk and dairy products may also be affected. A. butzleri colonises diverse and numerous ecological niches, such as water sources, ready-to-eat foods like vegetables, and food products of animal origin like meat, milk and cheese, fish and seafood. In addition, its survival and growth has been demonstrated in raw, pasteurised and UHT milk, and in the production and storage of ricotta cheese and artisanal water buffalo mozzarella cheese. These findings have led to A. butzleri being considered one of the emerging pathogens in milk and dairy products/environments of the 21st century (Fusco et al., 2020). Some Arcobacter species can cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans and animals. These are usually associated with abdominal pain and nausea, and watery diarrhoea but can also be asymptomatic. In general, a mild course of disease is observed in humans.#It is classified as an 'emerging pathogen' by some sources. Note: The regrouping of Arcobacter into the new genera Aliiarcobacter, etc., (Pérez-Cataluna et al. 2018) has already been revised again by an extended genome analysis (On et al. 2020 Syst Appl Microbiol.).#True#04.10.2019 00:00:00#07.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

82#F-2019-122#Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) in Enterococci#Enterococci are widespread and can be found in soils, surface water, vegetation and in fresh and processed foods, especially those of animal origin. Some antibiotic-resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis strains are responsible for an increasing rate of nosocomial infections.Three studies report the identification of a novel botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster (BoNT gene cluster) in the genome of an E. faecium strain. These findings are worrying as E. faecium are widely distributed in terrestrial animals as well as being a core component of human gut flora. There are concerns that botulism neurotoxins could be produced by such Enterococci. In food, BoNTs are produced preferably under low-oxygen conditions by Clostridium botulinum, and food poisoning is usually associated with food that has been inadequately sterilised. This often involves homemade canned vegetables.#As part of a larger investigation, the cantonal Food Inspectorate isolated enterococci routinely in drinking water samples which were then tested by the canton of Aargau for the presence of the BoNT gene cluster. This could not be detected in any of the enterococci strains examined from 12 cantons.#True#01.11.2019 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

83#F-2021-123#PFAS in food packaging#Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name "forever chemicals". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.#Research projects are currently being prepared at the Dutch RIVM that will deal with the use of perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl compounds (PFAS). Specifically, the aim is to develop proposals for restrictions on the use of PFASs. For the more than 4000 PFAS compounds, a classification into "essential uses" and "non-essential uses" is to be made.

85#F-2019-125#Nitrite in meat products#The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat may be linked to colorectal cancer. The cause is said to be nitrite curing salt, which is added to many products to prevent the growth of food spoilage bacteria, especially Clostridium botulinum. Several studies have investigated this hypothesis but have come to different conclusions. A connection between high nitrite intake from meat products and an increased cancer risk can neither be clearly proven nor disproven. Moreover, it is not only the consumption of a food that plays a role in the development of the disease, but the interaction between all lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette consumption, etc. Nitrite is not only absorbed through cured meat products, but is also formed as a degradation product of nitrate-containing foods in the body. These are mainly plant foods, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the supply of nitrogen to the plant. Examples of nitrate-containing foods are salads and vegetables such as rocket, spinach, kohlrabi, beetroot and radish. Furthermore, nitrate converted into nitrite can react with amines, amides or amino acids (present for example in the gastrointestinal tract or in the production of meat products) to form nitrosamines. Many nitrosamines are potent genotoxic carcinogens in laboratory animals and it is assumed that many nitrosamines are also human carcinogens.#`

A new study by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) concluded that two-thirds of us regularly consume processed meats containing nitrites daily — yet around 60 per cent are unaware that they may significantly increase their risk of bowel cancer. The WCRF says that its analysis of scientific research indicates that regularly consuming processed meats containing nitrites is linked to up to one in six bowel cancer cases in men; and one in 10 cases in women: World Cancer Research Fund ; The Irish News.

86#F-2019-126#Mercury in permafrost#New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.##True#18.11.2019 00:00:00#28.02.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

Minamata Convention on mercury (2017) : The Minamata Convention draws attention to a global and ubiquitous metal that, while naturally occurring, has broad uses in everyday objects and is released to the atmosphere, soil and water from a variety of sources. Controlling the anthropogenic releases of mercury throughout its lifecycle has been a key factor in shaping the obligations under the Convention. Major highlights of the Minamata Convention include a ban on new mercury mines, the phase-out of existing ones, the phase-out and phase-down of mercury use in a number of products and processes, control measures on emissions to air and on releases to land and water, and the regulation of the informal sector of artisanal and small-scale gold mining. The Convention also addresses interim storage of mercury and its disposal once it becomes waste, sites contaminated by mercury as well as health issues.

87#F-2019-127#Cyanide in foods#Bitter apricot kernels, flax seeds, and cassava contain cyanogenic glycosides in comparatively high concentrations as natural plant constituents. Cyanide is released by the enzyme ss-glucosidase, which is also contained in the plants, when they are eaten. After ingestion of a correspondingly high dose, cyanides can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy production.Bitter apricot kernels are of particular concern as they can lead to poisoning even in small amounts.The consumption of flax seeds is harmless to health if the common consumption recommendations of up to 15 g per meal are adhered to. According to the BfR (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices), there is no cyanide risk when eating marzipan and persipan.#Cyanide has already been detected in granola products (baked oatmeal), which can probably be attributed to added flax seeds.#True#19.11.2019 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

89#F-2021-129#Animal foods without animals#Social developments increasingly demand sustainable production of animal proteins. There is a trend to replace animal proteins with plant proteins, such as 'milk' based on almonds, rice, cashew nuts or pea proteins for burgers. There is also another alternative that develops animal proteins in the laboratory using biotechnological methods ('lab meat'). Besides meat from land animals, there are also trends to produce fish and seafood by biotechnological methods. Another future trend is the production of animal foods (meat, milk, ...) using bacteria in the laboratory.##True#08.04.2021 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

93#F-2021-133#Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods#Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: "Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used. Hence, synthetic cannabinoids are likely to pose a new risk.#EFSA: Cannabidiol novel food evaluations on hold pending new data (June 2022)#True#10.07.2021 00:00:00#10.08.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

94#F-2020-134#Large roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis)#The raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) is a common species of nematode found in raccoons. However, the parasites can also be transmitted to other organisms, such as when mammals or birds consume parasitic eggs excreted in raccoon faeces. Humans can also become infected with Baylisascaris. Most infections occur in children and others who accidentally put dirt or animal waste in their mouths. Infections are favoured by growing raccoon populations and increasing contact between raccoons and humans in densely populated habitats. In the USA, Baylisascaria have also been found in the intestines of dogs. As an alternative end host, dogs thus also pose a potential threat to humans.##True#06.01.2020 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

95#F-2020-135#Ultraprocessed food#Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.#The role of such foods and their influence on health is controversially discussed. Individual countries (e.g. Brazil, France) have adjusted their dietary recommendations. In France, for example, the consumption of such foods is to be reduced by 20%.#True#06.01.2020 00:00:00#22.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

98#F-2020-138#Ecdysterone in food supplements#Ecdysterone is a hormone from the ecdysteroids group, which is produced by many plants, including spinach, as a defence against predators. Ecdysteroids are used in agriculture (as insecticides), as medicines and also to enhance the performance of athletes. The popularity of ecdysteroids as food supplements is growing and more and more suppliers are marketing them as 'natural anabolic steroids', i.e. substances that promote muscle building. Results of recent studies suggest that their anabolic effect is achieved by binding to oestrogen receptors. The question arises as to the status of ecdysterone in sport, as the ingredient acts like a classic doping agent and should therefore be classified as 'other anabolic agents' by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA. However, they have not yet been included in the International Olympic Committee's doping list.##True#16.01.2020 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

99#F-2021-139#Acinetobacter in foods#Bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter have become a major problem in hospitals around the world because they often develop resistances to antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. A new study has now been able to find evidence of the same bacteria in food and food-producing animals. The study collected and analysed a wide variety of chicken, pork and beef meat samples from markets in Lima and Peru. Researchers found 12 Acinetobacter isolates from five different beef samples sold at two unrelated markets. However, it has to be mentioned that the Acinetobacter isolates found in this study had a low prevalence and were not multi-resistant. Raw meat thus appears to be a new potential source of infection for humans or a reservoir for Acinetobacter bacteria respectively.##True#01.05.2021 00:00:00#06.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

101#F-2021-147#Streptococcus agalactiae ST283 in fish#Streptococcus agalactiae is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause various infectious diseases. Previously. the pathogen was mainly known to cause severe neonatal infections (e.g., neonatal sepsis), but now S. agalactiae has also been linked to food, specifically the consumption of raw fish. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of severe invasive infections in Singapore, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, which could be traced back to sequence type (ST)283 of S. agalactiae. Epidemiological investigations revealed that the consumption of raw freshwater fish (tilapia) was the trigger. Follow-up investigations used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the prevalence of the bacterium more precisely. The result: S. agalactiae ST283 seems to have caused diseases in humans and farmed fish in Southeast Asia for decades. However, much remains unclear. If ST283 is transmitted exclusively from fish to humans, as was the case in the Singapore outbreak, then cases of S. agalactiae sepsis in Thailand and Laos are predominantly a food-borne disease. However, whether the transmission is from aquaculture to humans or vice versa, and whether there is an as yet unidentified reservoir, remains unknown. The germ could also be detected in tilapia from Brazil. Until now, the serotypes ST260 and ST927 were known in Brazil, but now ST283 also seems to be widespread. Based on import data of live tilapia from Singapore in 2014, a study suspects that the genotype was introduced into the country by the imported fish.#Potential 'emerging issue'#True#12.05.2021 00:00:00#19.10.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

102#F-2021-148#Antibiotics to treat citrus greening disease#Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is a bacterial disease affecting citrus fruit and is spread through an invasive insect, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Once a tree is infected, there is no effective way of controlling or curing it. The disease poses no threat to humans or animals but can infest all types of citrus trees making it a serious threat to the global citrus fruit industry. Antibiotics are being used in some countries to handle the problem. In the USA, there is a discussion about allowing farmers to use two antibiotics (streptomycin and oxytetracycline)  several times a year as a routine treatment. There is little scientific evidence on the long-term use of these drugs in crop environments. Further, the use of antibiotics on a small-scale has previously shown to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows farmers to harvest a few more crops from infected trees, however, the spread cannot be prevented. The potential use of antibiotics on a larger scale increases concerns about the developing resistance to antibiotics.##True#01.05.2021 00:00:00#06.08.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

103#F-2021-149#Post-harvest treatment of fruit and vegetables#Pathogenic fungi such as moulds are the main cause of plant diseases and cause an estimated 200bn CHF worth of damage in agriculture worldwide every year. A Swiss start-up wants to put an end to this problem by means of a group of substances extracted from plants of the cruciferous family, which is thought to be able to curb the evolution of various pathogenic fungi and thus extend the shelf life of numerous types of fruit and vegetables; depending on the variety, fruit and vegetables are said to stay fresh for two to four days longer.#Several trends come into play here, e.g., food waste could be avoided and a trend toward more 'naturalness'. Products to preserve the freshness of avocado are already on the market. FDA investigations show that Listeria monocytogenes are increasingly found on the skins, but it is unclear to what extent post-harvest treatment plays a role in this.#True#08.05.2021 00:00:00#01.01.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

108#F-2021-195#Residues of veterinary drugs in groundwater#Due to the intensification of food production in Europe, veterinary medicines have become a critical component in animal husbandry. The administration of these products can potentially lead to their presence in environmental waters such as groundwater, which is why they are now considered potential groundwater contaminants. In Ireland, several residues of anthelmintic and anticoccidial veterinary drugs have been detected in groundwater. 22% of 106 sampling sites detected residues of anthelmintics in the range of 1-41 ng/L and anticoccidials in the range of 1-390 ng/L. Residues were higher near intensive farming sites. These veterinary drug compounds are associated with a range of acute as well as chronic side effects, and their degradation products may have additional adverse effects.#The Federal Environment Agency (Germany) wrote a report on the topic in 2014 and came to the following conclusion: 'Overall and against the background of the worst-case approach, it can be concluded that the input of veterinary medicinal products into near-surface groundwater does not occur ubiquitously under the natural and hydrogeological conditions in Germany. Under particularly unfavourable site conditions, however, evidence of the substances has been found in individual cases, in some cases to a very marked extent'.Scope of the Environmental agencies; no further activies from FSVO.#True#05.05.2021 00:00:00#31.01.2023 00:00:00#20#true#70#`--- Primary ---Mooney et al.

110#F-2020-197#Clostridioides difficile#Researchers in Slovenia have published the results of a long-term, national Clostridioides difficile food surveillance project (formerly Clostridium difficile). Positive results were detected in meat, vegetables and fruits, as well as poultry. For meat, the most direct route of Clostridioides difficile contamination is via faeces during slaughter, but post-production processing could also play a role. The main sources of contamination of vegetables are soil or indirect faecal contamination through irrigation or fertilisation. Hand contamination during handling of meat and vegetables is also possible. The study found that the proportion of Clostridioides difficile-positive meat and vegetable samples is increasing every year. However, the number of samples tested was too small to speculate on possible trends, and given the low detected prevalence of contaminated samples, the food safety risks are likely to be very low for the types of food tested.##True#29.06.2020 00:00:00#23.08.2025 00:00:00#20#true#20#`--- Primary ---

113#F-2020-210#Tenuazonic acid (TEA)#Tenuazonic acid (TEA) is a mould toxin (mycotoxin) produced mainly by moulds of the genus Alternaria; more than 70 toxins have been described for this genus. Due to the widespread occurrence of Alternaria spp. on plants used for food production, TEA can often be detected in various foods. Contamination of tomatoes and tomato products (e.g. ketchup) with TEA is a known problem and occurs mainly when already mouldy tomatoes are processed. Accordingly, the detection of TEA can serve as a quality characteristic, as increased toxin contents are an indication that ingredients affected by mould have been processed. In addition to tomatoes and tomato products, cereals and cereal products, sunflower seeds and spices are also among the foods that may be preferentially contaminated with alternariatoxins. Due to a lack of comprehensive toxicological data, there are currently no legal regulations for the assessment of alternariatoxins in food and thus no maximum values for food. However, a scientific opinion of the EFSA from 2011 is available, which is used as a guideline for the risk of alternariatoxins in food. According to this, the TTC (threshold of toxicological concern) for TEA is 1.5 µg/kg body weight per day. Accordingly, a person weighing 60 kg may consume a product containing up to 90 µg/kg TEA every day without suffering health damage.#Dietary exposure estimates for the non-genotoxic tenuazonic acid are below the relevant TTC and are considered unlikely to affect human health (EFSA, 2011).#True#01.09.2020 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

115#F-2021-231#Salmonella Napoli - seasonality#Individual cases salmonellosis, spread throughout Switzerland and attributable to a specific salmonella species, were frequent in 2019. However, the occurrence of S. Napoli is particularly striking. The cases that have been occurring since 2002 show a seasonal pattern. The weekly threshold defined by the FOPH was exceeded in 2019, triggering investigations which, however, did not reveal any indication of a possible cause of the illness mentioned above. At present, there are no indications of sources or causes of infection. According to literature studies, the pathogen occurs conspicuously often on rocket. However, further investigations also show an association with surface water. Water could thus be a central source, whether as irrigation water for salads and vegetables or as water associated with leisure activities (bathing, swimming, paddling, etc.). Animal products, on the other hand, seem to be of secondary importance. In contrast to other Salmonella serovars, this pathogen seems to cause more invasive diseases in addition to gastrointestinal diseases.##True#02.05.2021 00:00:00#01.01.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

116#F-2021-232#Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential#The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).#The annual reports by the cantonal and border authorities do not show any results indicating the presence of Anisakis in fish sold in or imported into Switzerland.

117#F-2021-233#Soybean oil - cause of neurological diseases#The consumption of soybean oil has increased dramatically over the last fifty years and is associated with obesity and diabetes. To test the hypothesis that soybean oil diets alter hypothalamic gene expression in relation to metabolic phenotype, the research group below performed RNA sequencing analysis with male mice that were fed isocaloric, high-fat diets based on conventional soybean oil (high in linoleic acid, LA), a genetically modified low-LA soybean oil (plenish) and coconut oil (high in saturated fat, without LA). Both soybean oil diets had similar but not identical effects on the hypothalamic transcriptome, while the coconut oil diet had a negligible effect compared to a low-fat control diet. Dysregulated genes were associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine, neurochemical and insulin signalling. Oxt was the only gene with metabolic, inflammatory, and neurological relevance that was upregulated by both soybean oil diets compared to both control diets. Oxytocin immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus was reduced, while plasma oxytocin and hypothalamic Oxt were increased. These central and peripheral effects of the soybean oil diet correlated with glucose intolerance but not with body weight. In the coconut oil diet enriched with stigmasterol, a phytosterol derived from soybean oil, changes in hypothalamic Oxt and plasma oxytocin were not observed. The research team discovered about 100 other genes that are also affected by the soybean oil diet. They believe that this discovery could have implications not only for the energy metabolism, but also for important brain functions and diseases such as autism and Parkinson's disease. However, it has been indicated that there is no evidence that the oil causes these diseases. Furthermore, the team noted that the findings only applied to soybean oil - not to other soy products or other vegetable oils.#One note about this study: the research team could not yet isolated which chemicals in the oil are responsible for the changes they found in the hypothalamus. But they have ruled out two candidates. It is neither linoleic acid nor stigmasterol, a cholesterol-like compound that naturally occurs in soybean oil.#True#05.01.2021 00:00:00#19.08.2024 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.#Due to the fact that the germ is rhamnose negative, it could easily be overlooked.#True#22.12.2020 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

121#F-2021-239#Campylobacter lanienae at the slaughterhouse#Foodborne campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial enteritis in Germany. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.##True#31.01.2021 00:00:00#28.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

2. The metabolism was investigated: When 14C-3-nitrooxypropanol is administered to lactating goats, part of the radioactivity is exhaled as CO2. In the milk, a part appears as lactose. A large proportion of 3-nitrooxypropanol is degraded and recycled, probably via 3-hydroxypropionic acid.

124#F-2021-256#Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a uropathogen#Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a major cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young women. S. saprophyticus colonises humans and animals, but basic features of its molecular epidemiology are undetermined. Lawal et al. 2021 performed a phylogenomic analysis of 321 S. saprophyticus isolates collected from human UTIs worldwide from 1997-2017 and 232 isolates from human UTIs and the swine processing chain in a limited region from 2016-2017. They found epidemiological and genomic evidence that the meat production chain is a major source of S. saprophyticus causing human UTIs; the human microbiota is another possible origin. Pathogenic S. saprophyticus belonged to 2 lineages with distinguishable genetic characteristics that are globally and locally distributed. Genomic analyses identified a strong association between pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance, phages, platelet-binding proteins and an increased recombination rate.S. saprophyticus is part of the normal human flora that colonises the perineum, rectum, urethra, cervix and gastrointestinal tract. S. saprophyticus has also been found to be a common gastrointestinal flora in pigs and cows and can therefore be transmitted to humans through the consumption of these foods.##True#24.02.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

125#F-2021-257#Melatonin for post-harvest treatment#Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is known as a potential free radical. In a study by Li et al. (2021), the prolonged effect of the shelf life of white champignons was investigated. These had a significantly longer shelf life depending on the treatment. Melatonin also delays the leaf senescence of Chinese cabbage (Tan et al. 2020) or the yellowing of broccoli (Wu et al. 2021 or Miao et al. 2020). It is also employed in the ripening of fruit (such as tomatoes; Sun et al. 2020) or to increase the resistance of grapes (Gao et al. 2020). Melatonin is found in plant-based foods and in very small doses also in animal foods. The highest melatonin content is found in cranberries (up to 9,600 µg/100g dry weight). Other sources of melatonin are some types of mushrooms (saffron milk cap, common boletus, agaricus bisporus, chanterelle), some types of cereals (corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley), mustard seeds, dried tomatoes and peppers, and some types of wine (wikipedia).#It is a substance used in vegetables to extend its shelf life without declaring the treatment. The use of melatonin is currently not allowed. There seems to be intensive research on such application in China. Whether such application is already being used commercially, remains unknown.#True#25.02.2021 00:00:00#19.08.2023 00:00:00#30#true#20#`

126#F-2021-273#6PPD-Chinon - car tire abrasion, artificial turf#Exposure of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to stormwater causes unexplained acute annual mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban streams to reproduce. Investigating this phenomenon, researchers identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a ubiquitous antioxidant found in tyre rubber worldwide. Retrospective analyses of representative U.S. West Coast road runoff and stormwater-influenced streams revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD quinone (<0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unexpected risks of 6PPD antioxidants to this aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for residues derived from tyre rubber.#Whether 6PPD quinone also poses a health risk to humans still needs to be determined. Artificial turf is also a concern because it often contains crumbs from old car tyres. In addition, other products containing rubber components could release the critical substance.#True#01.03.2021 00:00:00#14.08.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

129#F-2021-276#Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia albertii#Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003. This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live. Interactions between raccoons and other animals, such as wild mice and wild boar, may also be possible (Hinenoya et al. 2020).#E. albertii is known as an emerging zoonotic agent and has been isolated from various animals in Japan and the USA. It is likely that STEA is also present in EU member states and Switzerland, but is misidentified as E. coli. To get a clear picture and take appropriate measures, it would be good to know the exact STEA situation.The identification of the germ is not yet methodologically established, which leads to misidentifications. New isolation methods are proposed (e.g. Hinenoya, A. et. al. 2020).#True#28.03.2021 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

132#F-2021-279#Coconut oil as a cuisine trend#Given the high prevalence of diet-related health problems in modern society, including obesity and related problems such as type 2 diabetes, there is also a growing movement towards healthier eating. One of these trends is the increasing use of coconut oil, which is often touted as having potential health benefits. While most oils in our normal diets contain mainly long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), coconut oil, along with some other products such as palm kernel oil, contains mainly medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), usually 12 carbon atoms in length. MCFAs in general, whether from natural sources or synthetic, have become increasingly important in nutrition. While in controlled studies the results have been mixed [1], there is some evidence that MCFAs have some health benefits, including a decrease in obesity due to their faster metabolism in the body [2]. There is also evidence to suggest some health risks, such as the consumption of coconut oil leading to significantly higher LDL cholesterol levels compared to other oils [3] and the ability to induce insulin resistance [4]. In general, however, the exact mechanisms of MCFA metabolism have been poorly understood, making a thorough risk assessment difficult. A recent study [5] has examined the metabolism for MCFAs in detail compared to LCFAs and found that mainly two enzymes are involved, DGAT1 and DGAT2. The results shed some light and may not only explain why Etomoxir, a substance developed about 40 years ago to inhibit beta-oxidation of fatty acids, has massive side effects in patients, but also show that ingestion of coconut oil or other MCFAs may contribute to chronic diarrhoea in patients with a mutation in DGAT1. The link between DGAT1 deficiency and chronic diarrhoea had already been shown in a previous study, but was not sufficiently understood [6].##True#13.04.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

133#F-2021-280#Salinisation of fresh water#Freshwater salinisation is an emerging global problem that affects drinking water safety, ecosystem health and biodiversity, infrastructure corrosion and food production. Freshwater salinisation originates from a variety of anthropogenic and geological sources, including road salt, human-accelerated weathering, wastewater, urban construction, fertilisers, mine drainage, resource extraction, water softeners, saltwater intrusion and evaporative concentrations of ions due to hydrological changes and climate change. The complex interactions between salt ions and chemical, biological and geological parameters, and the consequences for the natural, social and built environment, are known as the freshwater salinity syndrome (FSS). 'We used to think that the addition of salts was not a big problem,' says Kaushal, a professor at UMD's Department of Geology and Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center. 'We thought we'd sprinkle it on the roads in winter and it would wash away, but we found that it stayed around and accumulated. Now we're looking at both the acute exposure risks and the long-term health, environmental and infrastructure risks of all these chemical cocktails that result from adding salts to the environment, and we're saying, 'This is becoming one of the most serious threats to our freshwater supply.' And that's happening in a lot of places that we're looking at in the United States and around the world.'#In Switzerland, salt from the Rhine salt works and from Bex is most likely to be used for road salt. Around 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes are produced annually for road salt use. This consists of 99.5% NaCl. Anti-caking agents are added to keep the salt storable.

134#F-2021-281#Pheophorbides and other hazards in algae products#Algae products with high levels of phophorbide (chlorophyll metabolite) have in the past (1970s) in Asia led to considerable health damage due to phototoxic effects in the consumers concerned. As a result, official limits were set for certain product groups in parts of Asia, but not so in the EU. It is therefore the responsibility of the food business operator to limit the content of pheophorbides in foods on the European market to a technologically unavoidable level in order to meet the requirements of European food law. The Japanese limit is 100 mg of pheophorbide present per 100 g, or 160 mg of cumulative pheophorbide (i.e. the amount of pheophorbide present plus the amount formed by chlorophyllase activity within a three-hour incubation at 37°C) per 100 g. In Taiwan, the limits only apply to dried seaweed with less than 7% residual moisture. They also do not apply to red and brown algae. According to the available literature, the minimum amount of pheophorbide that is photosensitising is 25 mg/day. Other chemical hazards - associated with algae - concern in particular iodine, cadmium, arsenic and lead, as well as microbiological hazards (see further documentation). Recent studies also show that red algae can be used in animal feed to reduce methane emissions from cattle stomachs. Chemical hazards from algae could find their way into the food chain via feed.#Although no case reports of phototoxic effects following the consumption of algae products have been published recently, as far as is known, the problem potentially persists.#True#22.06.2021 00:00:00#07.09.2024 00:00:00#30#true#20#`--- Primary ---

136#F-2021-283#Asparagopsis taxiformis as a fodder#Cows exhale the powerful greenhouse gas methane. One of the ways to limit methane emissions from cows is to feed them the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis. This seaweed contains high concentrations of bromoform, a substance that counteracts the formation of methane in the cow's rumen. Studies by Wageningen University & Research show that bromoform can get into the cow's milk and urine. Bromoform in its pure form is harmful to health. There are limits to the maximum amount of bromoform in drinking water, but no such limits for food.#Researchers find it worrying that the substance can be found in milk. EFSA feedback: We have no ongoing activities for Asparagopsis taxiformis as fodder material. It is not listed in the catalogue of fodder materials, but it is listed in the EU registery of fodder materials under the entry 'red algae meal', which includes the products of the genus Asparagopsis, with ID number 008818-EN.#True#12.05.2021 00:00:00#17.05.2022 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

137#F-2021-284#Fish oil as a food supplement#Currently, fish oil supplements are indicated for patients with elevated plasma triglycerides to reduce cardiovascular risk. Due to the high prevalence of elevated triglycerides in the population, they can be prescribed frequently. It is worth noting that low-dose omega-3 fatty acids are available over the counter. Some clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. People with this disorder are five times more likely to have a stroke. Lombardi et al (2021) found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared to placebo, with an incidence rate of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.54; p<0.001).#At first glance, this is a somewhat difficult study to classify, with few details on the methodology. It would be important to precisely define the inclusion/exclusion criteria of studies in a meta-analysis and to name the dosages of the individual test substances (omega-3 fatty acids is an umbrella term). This is missing in the publication, or the supplement, which is also brief, at least contains the dosages (depending on the study, 0.84-4 g/person and day).#True#12.05.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

138#F-2021-285#Brevetoxins - algal blooms#Brevetoxins (Ptychodiscus toxins, PbTx) are neurotoxic algal toxins of the dinoflagellate species Karenia. The toxins are named after Karenia brevis. Karenia brevis is a marine alga and component of the phytoplankton of tropical regions and is regularly observed in the Caribbean and especially in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it occurs as one of the causative agents of "red tides", known as red algal blooms, which are formed by mass reproduction of these algae (Wikipedia). Other microalgae are also suspected of producing brevetoxins. This is the case with K. mikimotoi, K. bicuneiformis, Chattonella marina, C. antiqua, Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that cause irritation of the mucous membranes and respiratory tract. The effect is similar to that of ciguatoxin, but those are less toxic. Brevetoxins were first detected in France in November 2018 in mussels in Corsica (117 μg/kg digestive gland). The associated water samples for phytoplankton monitoring showed the presence of Karenia spp. (a genus of microalgae, some species of which produce brevetoxins).#Marine biotoxins could also play a role in Europe in the future, not least due to the increase in sea temperatures as a result of climate change. This has prompted the French agency ANSES to conduct an assessment on brevetoxins.#True#28.10.2021 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

139#F-2021-286#Extraintestinal E. coli from poultry flocks#Escherichia coli is one of the most important bacterial species studied, commonly found as a commensal intestinal inhabitant of humans and various animals. However, E. coli also represents an extremely versatile and diverse pathogen capable of causing infections of the gastrointestinal tract, termed intestinal pathogenic E. coli, while others, termed extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), cause infections outside the gastrointestinal tract. ExPEC include the following different pathotypes based on the host and site of infection; uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which are responsible for urinary tract infections (UTI); avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) causing the most common disease, colibacillosis in poultry; septicaemia-associated E. coli (SEPEC) and neonatal meningitis-causing E. coli (NMEC) responsible for septicaemia and neonatal meningitis, respectively. ExPEC infections in humans are a significant cause of morbidity or mortality and are also mainly responsible for economic losses in poultry due to reduced production. Poultry could act as a source of extraintestinal infections such as urinary tract infections, meningitis, septicaemia in humans or systemic disease in animals and pose a significant threat to food safety and human and animal health.##True#19.05.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

140#F-2021-287#Human gut microbiome#The human gut microbiome is a diversified, resilient, immunostabilised, metabolically active and physiologically essential component of the human body. Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).##True#16.11.2021 00:00:00#03.12.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`--- Primary ---

If a straw is to be used only once, there is nothing to be said against the use of products made of durum wheat (e.g. raw macaroni noodles) from a health point of view. For straws made of paper and cardboard to be useful, substances must be added to prevent the paper from becoming soggy. They are also called wet-strengthening agents. Certain residues of these substances, especially chloropropanols, can pass into the food. If the specifications of BfR Recommendation No. XXXVI are adhered to during production, no adverse health effects are to be expected from the use of straws made of paper and cardboard according to current scientific knowledge.

143#F-2021-291#Circular economy#The Circular Economy (CE) is an approach that decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, avoids waste, opposes the linear economic model of 'take-produce-consume-waste' and replaces it with an economic model based on sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling in an (almost) closed loop. Such a shift from a linear economy to a circular economy is expected to significantly support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). However, the design and implementation of the circular economy requires careful consideration of the numerous trade-offs that may arise. This is a prerequisite for achieving SDG 3 (Good health and well-being).In the transition to a circular economy, it will be crucial to identify potentially emerging risks to the environment and food and feed safety in a holistic and integrated manner in order to achieve an optimal balance between opportunities, benefits and risks. It is important to ensure that food and feed safety and environmental health considerations are included at an early stage of research or policy initiatives related to recycling and the circular economy.#The efforts to move from a linear to a circular economy are part of the EU's European Green Deal. Linked to this are opportunities but also possible risks for food safety. These must be carefully examined and weighed up.

In the case of cattle, the animals are herded up a ramp in single file and within minutes are stunned, bled, skinned, split, and packed into fresh and frozen parts. They are then almost immediately loaded into articulated lorries for transport to supermarkets and restaurants. But even this raw, labour-intensive industry fell victim to a cyberattack. For almost three days, the global operations of JBS, the world's largest meat processor, were crippled by a ransomware attack on the company's IT systems (FT).#Ransomware is software that is used to paralyse a company's operations and then, only after a ransom has been paid, deblock them again (Wikipedia). Measures to prevent such attacks can be found under the term 'food defence'. This (together with food fraud, food safety, and food quality) completes the range of threats that must be considered in a company's management system. Cf.: John Spink, David L.

145#F-2021-293#Lactiplantibacillus plantarum - Plantacyclin B21AG#A traditional Vietnamese meat snack could be the key to developing a safe and natural food preservative that addresses the twin global problems of food waste and food-borne illness. The fermented pork snack, Nem Chua, is eaten raw but does not cause food poisoning if prepared properly. This is because Lactiplantibacillus plantarum B21 , which thrive in the fermented meat, produce a special compound that destroys more dangerous bacteria.#Plantacyclin B21AG belongs to a group of compounds known as bacteriocins, which are produced by bacteria to destroy rival strains of bacteria.Bacteriocins form holes in the membranes of the target bacteria. This causes the contents of the cell to leak out - effectively killing the bacteria. The problem is that most bacteriocins only work against one or two types of bacteria and they are not very stable under different environmental conditions. Only one nisin, which came on the market in the 1960s, is currently approved for use as a food preservative, in a market estimated to be worth more than $513 million by 2020, but this compound is temperature and pH sensitive, which limits its use.#True#14.06.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

146#F-2021-294#Green Deal - emerging risks?#The Farm to Fork strategy is at the heart of the European Green Deal, which aims to make food systems fair, healthy and environmentally friendly. The Farm to Fork strategy aims to accelerate the transition to a sustainable food system. In doing so, the Green Deal aims to:- have a neutral or positive environmental impact- contribute to mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts- Reverse biodiversity loss- Ensure food security, nutrition and public health and ensure that everyone has access to sufficient, safe, nutritious and sustainable food- Maintain food affordability while achieving more equitable economic returns,- Promoting the competitiveness of the EU supply sector and encouraging fair trade.However, this also entails proactively anticipating and addressing potential emerging risks to food/feed safety and the environment that may be associated with the transition to sustainable food systems. In particular, this means assessing the food safety implications of the following practices:-Reducing the use of antimicrobials in livestock;-increasing the acceptance of healthy and sustainable diets;-Reducing food waste in the circular economy;-Reducing dependence on chemical pesticides and excessive fertilisation & increasing -organic farming.##True#21.06.2021 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

For a long time, the market was dominated by products that were intended to increase athletic performance (e.g. through building muscle).In recent years, however, another market segment has established itself, that of so-called nootropics (substances with an effect on the central nervous system). These nutraceuticals (traditional/herbal remedies, food supplements, functional food) focus on increasing cognitive performance. Thus, physical and, above all, mental performance is to be increased by these products.##True#21.06.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

149#F-2021-297#ESKAPE pathogens transmission via food#ESKAPE is an acronym that encompasses the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, including: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. This group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can evade or 'escape' common antibiotics due to their increasing multi-drug resistance (MDR). As a result, they are the leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients worldwide, who are most at risk. The food chain is one of the main drivers of MDR transmission, as food is not sterile and can usually have microbiological contamination or become contaminated at certain stages of the food chain (i.e. cross-contamination, recontamination). Indeed, the food chain can act as a driver for MDR spread, enabling the survival or even multiplication of MDR pathogens. MDR transmission is not exclusive to foods of animal origin or fish; plant foods can also harbour MDR microorganisms, as vegetables can be contaminated during primary production by water contaminated with faecal material from wastewater from surrounding farms. In general, pathogens are not common in food and the main risk arises from the high prevalence of non-pathogenic microorganisms that can transfer AMR genes to other microbial species, including foodborne pathogens. It is well documented that genes encoding resistance are transferable between different bacteria in farm animals and also from them to bacteria in food and humans by horizontal gene transfer (i.e. transformation, conjugation and transduction).##True#19.09.2021 00:00:00#13.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

150#F-2022-298#Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome#New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria, E. coli (Escherichia coli) and E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis). Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as E. faecalis that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of E. coli and E. faecalis to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (Eurek Alert).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible "emerging risk". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the Klebsiella genus, such as K. pneumoniae, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of Klebsiella spp. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.#The reason for the risk assessment of allulose was an increase in infections with the highly virulent germ Clostridium difficile in the U.S., which in 2018, was described in conjunction with the use of another low-calorie sugar as a food ingredient, the disaccharide trehalose. This is no new criticism; what is new is that it focuses on the authorisation process per se.#True#25.05.2022 00:00:00#25.06.2023 00:00:00#40#true#20#`--- Primary ---

During the study, the metabolic response of the participants' blood was measured after drinking potato, rice and whey protein shakes. Appetite was also monitored over the following three hours to understand how these drinks may affect participants' hunger and food cravings.The researchers observed that vegan protein shakes resulted in a lower increase in blood insulin compared to whey, while potato protein prevented any increase in insulin. This could explain the better blood sugar control after eating the plant protein and raises the question of whether vegan protein shakes are better for people who need to control their blood sugar levels, such as diabetics and overweight people.

152#F-2021-300#Food waste: recycling leftovers#Various initiatives have been launched to reduce food waste. One of them is 'too good to go'. Too good to go, for example, is a movement against food waste and the app of the same name is the world's largest business-to-consumer marketplace for leftover food. In Switzerland, more and more unsold food is sold this way. The idea of using technology to connect people in the fight against food waste was developed in Denmark in 2016 and quickly implemented across Europe. The Too Good To Go app connects people at the right time and place to reduce food waste. Currently, 'to good to go' is active in 14 European countries, and has also been present in Switzerland since summer 2018. The Too Good To Go app aims to create a win-win-win situation: Users receive food that has expired or is close to its expiry date at a reduced price. In addition, there are campaigns that supplement the best-before date (BBD) with the phrase 'often good for longer'. Numerous manufacturers in Switzerland have already added this supplement to the best-before date on their products (Press room, to good to go).Food waste is an economic problem, but also a moral one. But what about food safety? In recent times, food is being used beyond its expiry date, but how safe is it? Since November 2019, a retail chain in Switzerland has also been offering 'wonder bags' to counteract food waste. Bags filled with surplus products that can no longer be sold can be ordered and collected. The products cannot be selected by the buyer. (Source: LT Magazine, Issue 11, 2019. 6.11.2019).#The approach of reducing food waste is to be welcomed. However, there is a risk that products at the end of their shelf life could have increased germ counts, which could lead to health problems for consumers if they are not consumed immediately or transported refrigerated. In addition to pre-packaged food, leftover menus from kitchens are also offered. The customers do not necessarily know what they are buying, as these are 'surprise boxes' with leftover food. This can be problematic for allergy sufferers. Inferior goods can also be sold fraudulently in this way. Efforts are being made along the food chain to reduce food waste. However, such measures must not adversely affect food safety. Guidelines for the handling of food ?#True#04.07.2021 00:00:00#11.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

153#F-2021-301#Proteus mirabilis (MDR) on chicken meat#Proteus mirabilis is an opportunistic human pathogen. In this study, a novel integrative and conjugative SXT/R391 element (ICE) named ICEPmiChnS012 was identified in multidrug-resistant P. mirabilis strain S012 isolated from a retail chicken in China. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ICEPmiChnS012 carried 22 resistance genes, including aac(6′)-Ib-cr, fosA3, blaOXA-1, blaCTX-M-65 and blaHMS-1. ICEPmiChnS012 harboured 10 copies of IS26 and IS26-mediated genetic rearrangements caused variations in the HS4 region. According to the authors of the study ( Jieyuan Lu, Kang Zhao, Huadong Xie, Rui Li, et al. 2021), this study was the first time that an unusual gene cassette array dfrA1-ereA1-aadA2 was found in P. mirabilis. And this is the first report of the identification of aph3-VI and blaHMS-1 in the VRIII region in P. mirabilis. The conjugation experiments proved that ICEPmiChnS012 could be transferred to Escherichia coli EC600 by conjugation. These results showed that ICEPmiChnS012 was a specific ICE carrying the largest number of antimicrobial resistance genes in the family of SXT/R391 ICEs. This element could serve as an important vehicle for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and should receive great attention.##True#05.07.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

154#F-2021-302#Streptococcus suis - from pigs to humans#The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent that causes fatal infections such as septicaemia and meningitis in humans. In recent decades, the number of reported human cases of S. suis infection has increased rapidly, and three epidemics were recorded in China in 1998, 2005 and most recently in 2016. The recent increase in the global spread of virulent S. suis suggests its adaptive evolution in humans. However, this has remained largely elusive as no evidence of genetic adaptation to humans has been reported. The bacterium Streptococcus suis has long been known to cause swine disease. A genomic analysis has narrowed down where and when the deadly bacterium jumped from pigs to humans: in Europe in the 1960s or 1970s. To trace the evolution of S. suis, researchers from China analysed 1,634 S. suis genomes collected over 36 years from pigs and humans in 14 countries. The genomes fell into three distinct groups, one of which was found mainly in humans. This group included strains that caused severe diseases in zebrafish, which the authors used as a model for human diseases. Some of these strains had been collected from pigs that showed no signs of disease, suggesting that asymptomatic animals may have acted as vectors that transmitted the bacterium to humans.

155#F-2021-304#Haff disease - caused by fish#Haff disease or black urine disease is caused by a toxin found in some fish. Symptoms include sudden extreme muscle stiffness, muscle pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, numbness, loss of strength throughout the body and dark brown urine. They usually occur between two and 24 hours after eating fish or shellfish. The disease was first described in 1924 near Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) on the Baltic coast, in people staying in the northern part of the Vistula Lagoon. In the following fifteen years, about 1000 cases were reported in humans, birds and cats, mostly in summer and autumn, and a connection with the consumption of fish (burbot, eel and pike) was established (Wikipedia). Isolated cases still occur today. It is not known whether the odourless and tasteless toxin, which cannot be destroyed by cooking, is caused by improperly stored and packaged fish or by something the fish consumed.#In the United States, a total of 29 cases of Haff disease were reported from 1984 to 2014. They were associated with carp, buffalo fish, lobster or Atlantic salmon. In recent years, more cases have been reported from China.#True#16.08.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

156#F-2021-305#Encephalitozoon cuniculi in foods (cheese)#Encephalitozoon cuniculi (formerly also called Nosema cuniculi) is a parasitic protozoan that lives obligately intracellularly in the kidney, brain and other organs. It is classified as a microsporidian (Wikipedia). Experimentally produced cheese made from goat's milk enriched with Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) or retail goat's cheese was fed to experimental mice susceptible to E. cuniculi infection in a study by Veckowà et al. 2021. The mice were killed during the suspected acute phase of infection and their tissue samples were subjected to molecular detection of specific E. cuniculi DNA. Specific E. cuniculi genotype II DNA was detected in the faeces and milk of three of the 99 goats kept on six farms in the Czech Republic. Under experimental conditions, the spores of E. cuniculi genotype II remained viable in artificially enriched fresh cheese and were capable of causing infection in laboratory mice. DNA of E. cuniculi genotype I and II was detected in eight out of nine goat cheeses purchased from different producers/breeders in the Czech Republic, and these cheeses were capable of causing infection in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice. The results of these experiments showed that spores of E. cuniculi genotype I and II can remain viable after cheese processing, so that fresh and soft cheeses should be considered as a potential source of microsporidia.##True#10.08.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

157#F-2021-306#Toxoplasma gondii in ostrich meat#Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide disease that affects humans and many animal species, including birds. Antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii have been detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. With the exception of a study from Spain, there is no information on the seroprevalence of T. gondii in ostriches from Europe. The aim of the study by Bàrtovà et al. (2021) was therefore to detect antibodies against T. gondii in farmed ostriches in the Czech Republic. Serum samples from 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus) collected from 9 farms were analysed by latex agglutination test. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 149 (36 %) animals. High seropositivity may, according to Bàrtovà et al., indicate a risk of infection from ostrich meat to humans. Brain and heart tissues appear to be suitable samples for PCR detection of T. gondii DNA. Ostriches can presumably react as serological non-responders to T. gondii infection. Bàrtov et al. suggest that ostriches may pose a high risk of toxoplasmosis to humans by consuming raw or inadequately cooked ostrich meat and that even seronegative ostriches may harbour T. gondii in their tissues.##True#10.08.2021 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

158#F-2021-307#Borg - extrachromosomal elements#A team analysing mud samples in the Western US has found striking DNA structures that appear to detect and "assimilate" genes from microorganisms in their environment, much like the fictional Borg from Star Trek, who take over the knowledge and technology of other species. The extra-long strands of DNA, which scientists have named in honour of the aliens, join a diverse collection of genetic structures, such as circular plasmids, known as extrachromosomal elements (ECEs). Most microbes have one or two chromosomes that encode their primary genetic blueprint. But they can harbour many different ECEs and often share them among themselves. These carry non-essential but useful genes, such as those for antibiotic resistance. Their enormous size, ranging from more than 600,000 to about a million DNA base pairs, distinguishes the Borg from many other ECEs. In fact, Borg are so huge that they accounted for up to a third of the length of the main chromosome in their host microbes. In addition to their remarkable size, Borg share several structural features: they are linear, not circular like many ECEs; they have mirrored, repetitive sequences at each end of the strand; and they have numerous other repetitive regions both within and between putative genes (Spektrum der Wissenschaft, 2021). Do they also have a potential to cause disease or play a role in antibiotic resistance?#The significance of these extrachromosomal structures needs to be further investigated, in particular whether they contain antibiotic resistance or other genetic elements that could influence the pathogenicity of an organism.#True#10.08.2022 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

159#F-2021-308#Colistin resistance - new transmissions#Colistin is a polypeptide antibiotic from the group of polymyxins. The antibiotic is mainly used in veterinary medicine and here predominantly for the treatment of intestinal diseases caused by bacteria, but also for other infections.In November 2015, a new mechanism was discovered by which bacteria can pass on the property of colistin resistance to other bacteria. This scientific finding has led to public debate about both, the use of the antibiotic in livestock and the spread of resistance to colistin.Resistance to colistin has been described in animal isolates for several years. For a long time, experts assumed that this was a non-transferable resistance that was firmly anchored in the chromosome of individual bacteria. The currently discussed colistin resistance, however, is mediated by genes of a gene family that can be transferred from germ to germ by a mobile genetic element (plasmid). A plasmid is a ring-shaped DNA molecule on which genes for different properties can be located and which can be transferred relatively easily between different germs. The gene discovered in 2015 is called mcr-1 and was first described in China. Further investigations have shown that this gene can also be located on the chromosome. This means that it can then also be passed on to all bacterial offspring. Investigations following the discovery of mcr-1 have led, also with the participation of the BfR, to the description of further transmissible genes and their variants for colistin resistance in livestock (mcr-2 to mcr-10). The discovery of further genes of this type is to be expected still (BfR, 2021).#Colistin resistance is also observed in salmonellae. Here, it is of immediate relevance for consumer health protection due to the pathogenic properties of salmonellae for humans. Further information can be found in the scientific publication by Borowiak et al. (doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00080). Resistance genes of this type have now also been detected in other bacteria (e.g., Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp.), which underlines their transferability even between bacteria of different genera.#True#10.08.2021 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

161#F-2021-310#Cocktail effects of agrochemicals#Cocktail effects and synergistic interactions of chemicals in mixtures are an area of great concern to both the public and regulators. The main issue is whether some chemicals can amplify the effects of other chemicals so that together they have a greater effect than predicted.Global concern about the widely documented decline of pollinators has led to the identification of anthropogenic stressors that individually adversely affect bee populations. Synergistic interactions between these stressors could significantly amplify their impact on the environment. To quantitatively assess the extent of this threat, a meta-analysis of 356 interaction variables from 90 studies in which bees were exposed to combinations of agrochemicals, nutritional stressors and/or parasites was conducted by Siviter et al. (2021). The authors found an overall synergistic effect between multiple stressors on bee mortality. A subgroup analysis of bee mortality found strong evidence of synergistic effects when bees were exposed to multiple agrochemicals at realistic levels, but interactions were no greater than additive expectations when bees were exposed to parasites and/or nutritional stressors. All interactive effects on fitness, behaviour, parasite load and immune responses were either additive or antagonistic; therefore, the potential mechanisms driving the observed synergistic interactions for bee mortality remain unclear. Environmental risk assessment systems that assume additive effects of agrochemical exposure risk may underestimate the interactive effects of anthropogenic stressors on bee mortality.#To what extent a synergistic occurrence of agrochemicals also influences human health, remains an important question. As early as 2011, three EU Scientific Committees (Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) expressed their views and formulated recommendations (SCHER, SCCS, SCENIHR, Opinion on the Toxicity and Assessment of Chemical Mixtures, 2012). A decision tree was proposed on how to assess such mixtures in terms of their risk. The findings of the Siviter working group are not exactly new, but they can now be traced back to a large data base and confirm findings of earlier, smaller studies. Active substances often occur simultaneously. Some combinations show synergistic combination effects that go far beyond what is predicted with current effect models. To date, only the combined additive effects of similarly acting chemicals have been accurately assessed, while the combined effects of dissimilar chemicals have in many cases been severely underestimated. Liess et al. (2020) have attempted to model these synergistic effects.#True#09.08.2021 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

162#F-2021-311#Human genes in crops increase yield#N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in RNA are essential for plants. Yu et al. (2021) show in their study that transgenic expression of the human RNA demethylase FTO in rice causes a more than threefold increase in grain yield under greenhouse conditions. In field trials, transgenic expression of FTO in rice and potato led to an increase in yield and biomass of about 50 %. The study also shows that the presence of FTO stimulates root meristem cell proliferation and root bud formation and promotes photosynthetic efficiency and drought tolerance, but has no effect on mature cell size, shoot meristem cell proliferation, root diameter, plant height or ploidy. FTO mediates substantial m6A demethylation (about 7% demethylation in poly(A) RNA and about 35% decrease in m6A in non-ribosomal nuclear RNA) in plant RNA, resulting in chromatin opening and transcriptional activation. Therefore, modulating m6A methylation of plant RNA is a promising strategy to dramatically improve plant growth and crop yield.#Human genes, which are incorporated into plants and lead to considerable improvements in crop yields, even in drought conditions, are tempting opportunities to create new genetically modified crops and develop them to market maturity. The question remains to what extent these GMOs interact with human genes in the human organism.#True#16.08.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

Since neither the FSVO nor our partners in enforcement have heard anything about this so far and we have also not received any information from customs, we are of the opinion that this is not taking place on a large scale. We can also assume that no donkeys are slaughtered in Switzerland for the purpose of obtaining donkey skin or that donkey skin is imported to produce gelatine in Switzerland. - Gelatine made from donkey skin is not authorised for placing on the market in the EU or the European Economic Area. Any import into the EU for pharmaceutical use would therefore not take place within the legal supply chain.- According to Swissmedic, medicinal products cannot be authorised under the notification procedure if they contain preparations that are not included in the list of traditional documented Asian substances.

164#F-2021-315#Staphylococcal enterotoxins#Staphylococci (and their enterotoxins) are the leading cause of food-borne illness (CFTI) with a confirmed or suspected agent in France and are a major cause of food-borne illness worldwide. Staphylococcal CFTIs are due to the ingestion of heat-resistant staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), preformed in food at the time of preparation. The vast majority of these CFTIs occur in restaurants, school canteens or in the home. Staphylococci and ES are most often detected in food samples and more rarely in the vomit and stools of patients. Very often, only ES are detected in contaminated food; the bacterial strains producing these toxins have been eliminated by the preparation conditions. It is therefore sometimes difficult to link ES to the producing strains. The detection of ES in food is therefore a crucial step in the surveillance of staphylococcal CAI.#ES are produced by toxigenic staphylococci as they grow. These toxins are formed in food contaminated with toxigenic staphylococci. Toxin production requires a bacterial concentration above 105 cells/g of food. ES are produced between 6.7°C and 45.5°C and are resistant to heat and digestive enzymes. They are destroyed by heating for at least 30 minutes at 100°C. Staphylococci, on the other hand, are not resistant to heat treatments above 60°C applied for more than 60 minutes. S. aureus (or Staphylococcus aureus) is the most common species implicated in food-borne illness and the most pathogenic of the Staphylococcus genus. Other toxigenic species, such as S. hyicus, S. intermedius or S. argentus (recently identified as a new species disassociated from S. aureus), have been implicated in food-borne outbreaks, but their presence in food remains poorly documented.#True#17.09.2021 00:00:00#07.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

165#F-2022-316#Marine toxins: an emerging risk in Europe?#Ciguatera is the most common form of marine biotoxin food poisoning in the world, with between 10,000 and 50,000 cases reported each year, a figure that is probably far from the reality. Ciguatera poisoning (CTXs) is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Pacific and Caribbean (West Indies). Ciguatera is a complex syndrome with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular effects. The symptoms appear two to twelve hours after the contaminating meal. The question of a possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain.#Over the eight-year period studied by EuroCigua (a European project on the characterisation of the risk of food poisoning by ciguatoxins), the trends observed do not reveal a strong increase in cases of ciguatera in Europe. Their occurrence is associated with the consumption of fish from intertropical areas and Macaronesia (Canary Islands and Madeira). However, the question of the possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain. Indeed, ciguatera has recently appeared in southern Europe (the first autochthonous European human cases were recorded in 2004 in the Canaries). A geographical extension has also been observed in East and South-East Asia. It is therefore to be feared that the geographical distribution of indigenous ciguatera will continue to spread northwards. At the EuroCigua 2020 international congress, the production of new knowledge was recommended: spectrum of consumed and potentially contaminated fish species, cytotoxicity of the various forms of toxins identified, development of methods adapted to the rapid control of batches of fish imported or caught in Europe, etc. This is therefore a weak signal, but one that needs to be investigated with the support of a wide range of stakeholders.EuroCigua II project website (in English and Spanish) has been launched at the institutional website of the Spanish Ministry of Health. This website is linked with the new EFSA topic page on “Ciguatoxins and other marine biotoxins”.#True#20.07.2022 00:00:00#18.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

Practically all people with a severely impaired kidney function have to limit their sodium and potassium consumption, so there is little point in widely promoting potassium salts, apart from the fact that they are much less sensory than table salt.#True#20.09.2021 00:00:00#25.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

167#F-2021-318#Non-thermal plasma for sterilisation#Non-thermal plasma, cold plasma or non-equilibrium plasma, considered the fourth state of matter after solids, liquids and gases, is formed by the breaking apart of gas molecules and the formation of a cloud of charged electrons and ions. Cold plasma is created by sending fast-moving and hot electrons through cold gases. Because cold plasma is energetic but cold, it has unique capabilities and possibilities. For example, a study (Ukuku et al. 2019), published in May 2019 in the journal LWT Food Science and Technology, investigated combinations of antimicrobials and cold plasma as treatments to reduce Listeria monocytogenes on apple surfaces. The study, published in LWT, found that a combination of antimicrobial solution and cold plasma treatment was effective in killing Listeria monocytogenes. Research studies seek to use cold plasma in the disinfection of water, which in turn is used for the sanitisation of salts. Other applications include disinfection of noroviruses in blueberries.#Cold plasma is an emerging non-thermal technology that offers the advantage of being chemical- and water-free, and can also operate openly and continuously at atmospheric pressure, Research into cold plasma treatment is ongoing, and results show promising signs of what the new technology could do in the area of food safety. Less known, however, are the side effects of such a hygienisation method.#True#26.10.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

168#F-2021-319#Enterocytozoon bieneusi - Microsporidia#In 2020, Denmark reported a large outbreak caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi, an obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasite belonging to the order Microsporidia (Li W et al., 2020). An unprecedented outbreak in a canteen caused by this pathogen affected 77 employees of a Danish company. E. bieneusi is a microorganism that is rarely found in Denmark and has not caused any outbreaks to date. The source of the outbreak was a lunch box in the company canteen, but a specific food item could not be identified.E. bieneusi is associated with food-, water- and hospital-associated outbreaks. Its identification requires molecular methods such as qPCR, which are not routinely used in most EU Member States.#Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a microsporidium related to Cryptomycota and fungi and has been found in a variety of mammals and birds worldwide. It is responsible for over 90% of documented cases of microsporidiosis in humans and causes various clinical symptoms, usually diarrhoea and emaciation. It mainly affects immunocompromised patients, but is also observed in immunocompetent individuals.#True#26.10.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

169#F-2021-320#Coumarin in food supplements#Coumarin is a natural flavouring and fragrance substance found in many plants (e.g., lavender) and thus also in some foods. It is found in higher concentrations in certain types of cinnamon and in woodruff. From a toxicological point of view, coumarin is considered to be a cause for concern as it has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal experiments in high doses; an increased cancer risk for humans has not yet been proven. Furthermore, coumarins inhibit the vitamin K metabolism and thus influence blood clotting. In high intake quantities, coumarin can cause liver damage, in extreme cases hepatitis with liver failure. Even small amounts of the substance can cause liver damage in sensitive individuals, although this damage is reversible.The genotoxicity (genetic damage) of coumarin could not be confirmed. Coumarin may be contained in cinnamon capsules in particular. At higher doses, it is possible to exceed the daily dose for coumarin (Verbraucherzentrale, Deutschland).##True#16.11.2021 00:00:00#30.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

Now the drink is to gain a stronger foothold in Switzerland as well, especially among young people. In the USA, Hard Seltzers experienced a boom in 2019 and already achieved a market share in alcohol of 10%. Plans for a market launch by large corporations and local start-ups in Switzerland also became known at the beginning of 2020. Due to the Covid pandemic with lockdown, social distancing and cancelled public events, the big launch efforts were eventually postponed. Nevertheless, during 2020, several Hard Seltzers already entered the Swiss market, both from small Swiss startups, small foreign companies and foreign corporations.#Advertising suggests that Hard Seltzers are refreshing and keep you slim and, at the same time, are something cool that belongs at every party. This is a problem for prevention. It also raises the question of whether this will trigger an increase in alcohol consumption among young people like alcopops did at the beginning of the noughties.#True#05.11.2021 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

173#F-2021-325#Sapovirus - zoonotic agent#Sapoviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They belong to the genus Sapoviruses within the family Caliciviridae. They infect people of all ages, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. The clinical symptoms of sapovirus gastroenteritis are indistinguishable from those caused by noroviruses, so laboratory diagnosis is essential to identify the causative agent. Sapovirus infections are a public health concern, causing acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide in both outbreaks and sporadic cases. Outbreaks often occur in semi-enclosed environments. Outbreaks due to food-borne transmission of sapoviruses have also been reported. Sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse. Currently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are widely used for the detection of sapoviruses from clinical samples because of their high sensitivity and broad reactivity and the lack of sensitive assays for antigen detection or cell culture systems for the detection of infectious viruses. Sapoviruses were first discovered in 1976 by electron microscopy in diarrhoeal samples from humans. To date, sapoviruses have also been detected in various animals: pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions and bats (Oka et al. 2015). Sapovirus is thought to be spread from person to person, through sewage infiltration into drinking water sources and via contaminated food. Among food-borne transmissions, seafood is a recognised source of sapovirus infection.##True#10.11.2021 00:00:00#14.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

174#F-2021-326#Does palm oil promote the spread of cancer?#Palm oil is obtained from the pulp of the palm fruit. The fruits are sterilised and pressed, resulting in the crude palm oil, CPO (Crude Palm Oil). Due to their high carotene content, fruits and oil have an orange-yellow to brown-red colour, which is removed during refining. Pure and fresh palm oil has a specific violet smell, a sweetish, pleasant taste and is clear and light in colour. Commercial oil, however, is usually cloudy and coloured due to less carefully executed preparation methods. The oil also becomes increasingly cloudy and has a more intense odour as it ages (Wikipedia). Fatty acid found in palm oil has been linked to the spread of cancer. Given that palm oil is in frequently used in our foods, this is a worrying report. The palmitic acid found in palm oil alters the genes of cancer cells and increases the likelihood of metastases forming.#These are results from a study on mice; further results are to be awaited. Clinical studies are needed to ultimately say that a diet low in palmitic acid also slows down the metastasis process.#True#22.11.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

175#F-2021-328#Postbiotics#Postbiotics are functional bioactive compounds that are produced in a matrix during fermentation and can be used to promote health. The term postbiotics can be considered an umbrella term for all synonyms and related terms of these microbial fermentation components. Therefore, postbiotics can include many different components, including metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbial cell fractions, functional proteins, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), cell lysates, teichoic acid, peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides and pili-type structures. Postbiotics is also a fairly new term in the field of 'biotics'. While there is a consensus for the definitions of pre- and probiotics, one for postbiotics is still under discussion. A definition was formulated in 2021 by 'The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP)'. Postbiotics are defined as 'preparations of inanimate microorganisms and/or their constituents that confer a health benefit to the host'. Research to date suggests that postbiotics may have direct immunomodulatory and clinically relevant effects, and there is evidence of the use of postbiotics in healthy people to improve general health and alleviate symptoms in a range of conditions such as colic in infants and atopic dermatitis in adults, as well as in various causes of diarrhoea.#This is a new subject area, although a wide variety of products are probably already on the market.#True#22.11.2021 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

177#F-2022-330#Vanadium in foods#In 2018, the BfR issued a statement on vanadium. The background to this was the detection in mineral water or spring water, where in some samples the levels of vanadium were above the de minimis threshold of 4 µg/L set by the "Länderarbeitsgemeinschaft Wasser". Maximum levels for drinking water, mineral water or other foodstuffs do not exist. High levels in mussels and dark chocolate are known from the French Total Diet Study; the levels measured in cereal products and milk are lower. Cigarette smoke is also a source of exposure. For the assessment, the problem arises that health-based guideline values of different magnitudes have been derived by various bodies on the basis of different studies and toxicological endpoints. The uncertainty in the health assessment of the occurrence of vanadium in food is correspondingly high. Only for vanadium pentoxide are there harmonised classifications for toxicological properties within the EU. On the basis of the available data, the BfR concludes in its opinion in a weight-of-evidence assessment that vanadium compounds are to be regarded as genotoxic in vivo. The classifications of national and international bodies on carcinogenic properties only concern vanadium pentoxide or inorganic compounds after inhalation exposure. Oral studies on carcinogenesis are not known. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent the data from studies with inhalation exposure to vanadium pentoxide are relevant for the oral intake of vanadium via food (including drinking water). No report is yet available on the ongoing National Toxicology Program (NTP) studies on genotoxicity. Furthermore, a re-evaluation by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has started in 2020. Also in 2020, BfR has submitted a request to EFSA for health assessment in food and derivation of health-based guidance values. A timetable for EFSA's work on the topic is not yet available.#Oral studies on carcinogenesis are not known.

René Schnorr, Heike Rautenberg und Uta Räde: Bericht zum Auftreten von Vanadium im Trinkwasser in Sachsen-Anhalt, Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz Sachsen-Anhalt (Dezember 2020): 'Die bislang vom LAV erhobenen Daten zeigen, dass das Auftreten von Vanadium im Trinkwasser geogen bedingt und somit regional geprägt ist. Eine Korrelation mit den hydrochemischen Hintergrundwerten des Grundwassers lässt sich jedoch nicht konsequent ableiten. Insgesamt werden landesweit in allen Wasserversorgungsanlagen nur sehr geringe Konzentrationen beobachtet, nur vereinzelt beobachtet man höhere Konzentrationen. Die toxikologischen Daten, die dem Leitwert von 4 µg/L zugrunde liegen, sind allerdings nicht ausreichend, um eine abschliessende und verlässliche toxikologische Bewertung vorzunehmen. Vor dem heutigen Kenntnisstand schätzen wir den Gebrauch des Trinkwassers (im Sinne der TrinkwV) als unbedenklich ein.

178#F-2022-334#Protozoan parasites in foods#Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.#Due to the lack of standardised methods and the absence of a reporting obligation, the significance of parasitic protozoa in Switzerland cannot be conclusively assessed.#True#02.08.2022 00:00:00#14.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

179#F-2022-335#Staphylococcus argenteus#`Staphylococcus argenteus has recently been proposed as a new species within the S. aureus complex (SAC). S. argenteus has been found in many countries and can pose a threat to human health. It is known to cause various diseases in humans such as skin and soft tissue infections, sepsis and staphylococcal food poisoning. A study by Wakabayashi et al. (2022) investigated the prevalence of S. argenteus in retail fresh food and poultry slaughterhouses in Japan. Of 642 food samples examined, S. argenteus was successfully isolated in 21 of 151 (13.9 %) chicken samples. No isolations were confirmed from pork, beef, fish or vegetable samples in retail markets.The findings of Wakabayashi et al. (2022) suggested that chicken meat was significantly contaminated with this bacterium and could be a source of human disease. The molecular epidemiological study by Wakabayashi et al. (2022) found that meat processing plants could be partly responsible for the spread of the bacterium from the environment to food and vice versa.Staphylococcus argenteus has been recently established as a novel species of the Staphylococcus aureus complex. It is known to cause various human diseases, such as skin and soft-tissue infections, sepsis, and staphylococcal food poisoning, although the source of infection has not been clearly described. In food poisoning cases, the source of bacterial contamination in food is unknown.

Staphylococcus argenteus was isolated from chicken meat and slaughterhouse samples.


Twenty-one isolates from chicken meat were classified into 14 genotypes.
Sequence type 2250, a clone spreading globally, was not a predominant genotype.
WGS showed possible bacterial contamination of chicken meat in the slaughterhouse.

180#F-2022-336#Nano coating of foods#There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called "smart packaging"). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.#There is a clear trend towards more sustainable food packaging that is made from natural raw materials and does not generate waste. While the ecological and technological benefits of these new products are relatively clear, the associated risks have not yet been sufficiently clarified and researched. The FSVO is confronted with both legal questions about the classification of these products and health questions about the nanoforms of these products.The project seems to be making great progess. The question about what effects such a coating will have on food safety remains unanswered.

181#F-2022-337#Safety of probiotics#`The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).
`#Potential health risks related to the use of probiotics are documented in the scientific literature, although they are still poorly known compared to the beneficial aspects. Specifically for people at risk (pre-existing diseases, e.g. cancer), the health impact of probiotic consumption (in food or supplement form) should be clarified.#True#17.03.2022 00:00:00#27.01.2024 00:00:00#20#true#20#`--- Primary ---

182#F-2022-338#Metagenomics approaches to improve food safety#Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have dramatically reduced the cost and increased the ease of microbial whole genome sequencing. This approach is revolutionising the identification and analysis of foodborne microbial pathogens, facilitating expedited detection and mitigation of foodborne outbreaks, improving public health outcomes, and limiting costly recalls. However, next-generation sequencing is still anchored in the traditional laboratory practice of the selection and culture of a single isolate. Metagenomic-based approaches, including metabarcoding and shotgun and long-read metagenomics, are part of the next disruptive revolution in food safety diagnostics and offer the potential to directly identify entire microbial communities in a single food, ingredient, or environmental sample.##True#21.03.2022 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

183#F-2022-339#Coxiella burnetii increase in animal population#Q fever is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The natural reservoir of the pathogen is cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, some wild animals and ticks. Infected animals often show no symptoms, but excrete the pathogen mainly via birth products of farm animals (e.g. placenta), which are usually highly infectious, but also via faeces, urine or milk. In the majority of cases, infection in humans occurs through inhalation of dust containing the pathogen, but also through direct contact with infected animals. People who are in close contact with animals (animal owners, veterinarians, slaughterhouse employees, etc.) are particularly affected. Depending on the wind conditions, however, people in the immediate vicinity of infected animals can also become infected. In about half of the people infected, the infection causes no symptoms or only mild flu-like symptoms that disappear spontaneously. The other half experience sudden fever, chills, sweating, fatigue and headache, which can be complicated by inflammation of the lungs, liver, heart muscle or brain. Q fever is usually treated with antibiotics to prevent the disease from becoming chronic. Besides sporadic cases, outbreaks can also occur.There is a steady increase of reported cases in the animal population since 2014 in Switzerland; cattle: 2014: 54; 2021: 131; Goat: 2014:3; 2021: 19; sheep 1; 2021:10). In 2020, a total of 51 human cases of Q fever were reported to the FOPH, which corresponds to a reporting rate of 0.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the previous year, there were almost twice as many cases due to an outbreak, with 101 cases. The outbreak was most likely linked to two infected goat herds in Ticino. There is no similalr increase in the human population as observed in the animal population.##True#31.03.2022 00:00:00#01.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

187#F-2022-343#Herbs and spices - fraudulent manipulations#Culinary herbs and spices are valued for flavouring food and could also provide other beneficial properties, such as antioxidative and bacteriostatic effects as well as certain pharmacological activities. Their supply chain is complex, long, and globalised. Europe is one of the world’s leading importing regions for herbs and spices, importing approximately 300.000 tons, mostly spices from East Asia. Most of the spices are produced in countries where certain post-harvest processes such as drying and cleaning may happen before being shipped to the importing country where they are further cleaned and sanitised before being packaged and distributed either to other food businesses or for retail consumption. At each stage, fraudulent manipulations may happen and the more often the material is transferred from one operator to the next, the fraud opportunity increases#The coordinated control plan is until now the largest investigation into the authenticity of culinary herbs and spices in terms of participating countries (21 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland) and samples analysed (1885). The overall rate of suspicious samples was 17% (323 of a total of 1885 analysed samples), which is less than what was previously reported in the scientific literature or by national food control institutions. The oregano supply chain was most vulnerable as 48% of samples were suspicious of being adulterated, in most cases with olive leaves. The percentage of samples which were suspicious of adulteration were 17% for pepper, 14% for cumin, 11% for curcuma, and 11% for saffron.#True#02.05.2022 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

188#F-2022-344#Trifluoroacetate (TFA) in water#Trifluoroacetate (TFA) is a mobile and persistent substance that is primarily introduced into the water cycle through the degradation of various fluorochemicals and remains there for an unforeseeable period of time. There is already a high baseline load of TFA in many water bodies with some regional hotspots. This background paper presents current data and estimates on sources, input pathways, loads, impacts and measures on TFA. It gives an outlook on first activities and options to comprehensively minimise TFA inputs to the environment. Despite gaps in knowledge, it becomes clear that consistent regulation and an overarching minimisation strategy must be initiated in the short term.##True#03.05.2022 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.#First cases have also been reported in Switzerland.#True#08.05.2022 00:00:00#18.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

193#F-2022-349#Taste disorders after eating pine nuts#Pine mouth, also known as Pine Nut Syndrome (PNS), is an uncommon dysgeusia that generally begins 12–48 hours after consuming pine nuts. It is characterized by a bitter metallic taste, usually amplified by the consumption of other foods, which lasts 2–4 weeks. Recent findings have correlated this disorder with the consumption of nuts of the species Pinus armandii . Inedible types of pine nut may accidentally or fraudulently find their way onto the market and cause lingering taste disturbances. This phenomenon peaked in France in 2009, with 700 cases reported to the network of poison control centres in August of that year alone. Although there have been far fewer cases in recent years – around ten annually – the problem has not gone away and a slight increase was observed in 2021. ANSES reiterates the recommendations regarding this type of poisoning: report any persistent bitterness after eating pine nuts and keep the packaging so that the product batch concerned can be withdrawn or recalled.Pine nuts are small oilseeds that are generally consumed as is, or used to garnish a dish or a drink, or in culinary preparations such as pesto. Despite health controls, inedible (and therefore cheaper) varieties of pine nuts are offered for sale, often mixed with edible pine nuts, and can cause a particularly unpleasant taste disturbance called dysgeusia. This leaves a metallic and/or bitter taste in the mouth, which is exacerbated by eating or drinking any kind of food or drink. Sensitivity varies according to the individual: after consuming the same product, some will experience the adverse effect and others will not. An earlier retrospective study from March 2008 to January 2010 had counted more than 3000 symptomatic cases in France reported to the network of poison control centres after exposure to pine nuts. Most of these occurred in 2009 with a peak of around 700 cases in August 2009. This peak was due to the consumption of inedible pine nut species from China that had only recently arrived on the market.In Australia, the phenomena is called 'pine mouth'. The cause of pine mouth has not been determined, but several researchers have indicated that a particular species and source of pine nut, Pinus armandii exported from the Shaanxi and Shanxi regions of China, may be responsible for causing the symptoms. This species of pine nut was previously only consumed locally and not widely exported for consumption as whole nuts.In response to the increased number of pine mouth cases, the Chinese authorities have implemented measures to accredit exporters of pine nuts and implement strict control measures to ensure Pinus armandii are no longer exported. In addition, the international standards setting body Codex Alimentarius Commission has moved to exclude Pinus armandii as well as another species of pine nut Pinus massoniana from its list of edible tree nuts.##True#10.06.2022 00:00:00#19.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

195#F-2022-351#Antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural soils#Antibiotic resistance genes may be considered as environmental pollutants if anthropogenic emission and manipulations increase their prevalence above usually occurring background levels . The prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII and aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII, frequent marker genes in plant biotechnology conferring resistance to certain aminoglycosides, was determined by Woegerbauer et al. (2015) in Austrian soils from 100 maize and potato fields not yet exposed to but eligible for GMO crop cultivation . Total soil DNA extracts were analysed by nptII/nptIII-specific TaqMan real time PCR. Of all fields, 6% were positive for nptII (median: 150 copies/g soil; range: 31-856) and 85% for nptIII (1190 copies/g soil; 13-61600). The copy-number, deduced prevalence of nptIII carriers, was 14-fold higher compared to nptII. Of the cultivable kanamycin-resistant soil bacteria, 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 0-3.3%) were positive for nptIII, none for nptII (0-0.8%). The nptII-load of the studied soils was low rendering nptII a typical candidate for environmental pollution upon anthropogenic release into these ecosystems.#This highlights the importance of properly designed circular economy practices embedded into a holistic/integrated/one-health framework as we could really fix a problem and create another one.#True#11.07.2022 00:00:00#24.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

196#F-2022-352#PFOS in meat#Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (conjugate base perfluorooctanesulfonate) is an anthropogenic (man-made) fluorosurfactant, now regarded as a global pollutant. There is a major focus on PFOS hotspot contaminations in DK right now. During the spring and summer a site previously used for training fires and firefighting has been investigated. A field close to the site was used for grassing by cows owned by 20 families. Five cows each summer has been grassing there. PFOS is analysed in the meat at concentrations from 156 to 230 ng/g in four samples from four cows. Also grass was analyzed from the area up to 165 ng/g and water in the stream showed very high levels. The theory is that rainwater is running off in the direction of the field and the stream. So the cows have had the intake both from the water in the stream and from the grass. About 187 local consumers, that have eaten the meat through the years, have had the blood analyzed for PFOS. There are a big variation of PFOS in the blood. From 1,1 ng/ml up to 500 ng/ml. Doctors at the nearby hospital will follow the people who has high levels in the blood and try to help them. They will now try to use a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that is thought to increase the secretion of PFOS. 145 other areas around DK, where use of PFOS has been going on, will now be investigated.#In accordance with the decisions adopted at the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP4) to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Convention, SR 0.814.03) and the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 , the handling of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) is prohibited in Switzerland. Exemptions apply for applications where no substitutes for PFOS are available at present. In addition, under the POPs Convention, notification requirements apply for applications where use remains permissible.#True#04.08.2022 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

197#F-2022-353#Chlorophyllum molybdites: an emerging risk?#Chlorophyllum molybdites, which has the common names of false parasol, green-spored Lepiota and vomiter, is a widespread mushroom. Poisonous and producing severe gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, it is commonly conflated with the shaggy parasol or shaggy mane, and is the most commonly misidentified poisonous mushroom in North America. Its large size and similarity to the edible parasol mushroom, as well as its habit of growing in areas near human habitation, are reasons cited for this. The nature of the poisoning is predominantly gastrointestinal (Wiki). Chlorophyllum molybdites is exotic to Italy and its presence has been reported over recent years. It grows easily in gardens and parks and people are picking it and have intoxications also after prolonged cooking. It causes gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Very high numbers of cases are reported worldwide. In Sicily (Southern Europe) it grows abundantly in coastal areas. The first intoxications in Europe were reported in Italy (Sicily) and Spain in 2014. Cases in Sicily are increasingly being reported.##True#13.07.2022 00:00:00#31.08.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

199#F-2022-355#STEC contamination in pork production chain#Epidemiological evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections associated with the consumption of contaminated pork highlight the need for increased awareness of STEC as an emerging pathogen in the pork supply chain. The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets. In retail pork, serogroup O26 was prevalent in the U.S., Europe, and Africa. Serogroup O121 was only reported in the U.S. Furthermore, serogroup O91 was reported in the U.S., Asia, and South American retail pork samples. The most common virulence gene combination in retail pork around the globe were as follows: the U.S.: serogroup O157 + stx, non-O157 + stx, unknown serogroups+stx + eae; Europe: unknown serogroups +(stx+ eae, stx2 + eae, or stx1 + stx2 + eae); Asia: O157 + stx1 + stx2 + ehxA, Unknown+stx1 + eaeA + ehxA, or only eae; Africa: O157 + stx2 + eae + ehxA. STEC strains derived from retail pork in the U.S. fall under low to moderate risk categories capable of causing human disease, thus indicating the need for adequate cooking and prevention of cross contamination to minimize infection risk in humans.##True#04.08.2022 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

200#F-2022-356#Laribacter hongkongensis in food matrices#Laribacter is a novel genus that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of β-subclass Proteobacteria, first isolated in Hong Kong in 2001 and associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and travellers’ diarrhoea in humans. It is a Gram-negative S-shaped motile facultative anaerobic bacillary bacterium . It has also been reported in some fish, seafood, as well as waste-contaminated water. Previous studies on freshwater fishes of the carp family have reported the isolation of L. hongkongensis. Laribacter hongkongensis is a human pathogen harboured in food and environmental matrices. Infectious manifestation of L. hongkongensis has been recorded in Hong Kong, travel-related gastroenteritis in Denmark, acquired gastroenteritis in the United States, bacteraemia, peritonitis , community-acquired gastroenteritis, hospital-based isolation in Thailand and bacteraemia with neutropenic sepsis in Malaysia. In addition, L. hongkongensis bacteraemia could be associated with mortality due to underlying liver diseases. A study aimed to meta-analyse the prevalence of L. hongkongensis in humans, aquatic products, food/non-food animals, and environmental waters to provide update information on the pathogen. Overall, the prevalence of L. hongkongesis in human, aquatic products, food/non-food animals, and environmental waters was 8.5% (95% CI: 5.8–11.7). The leave-one-out influence analysis yielded a pooled prevalence of L. hongkongensis ranging from 8.1% (95% CI: 5.4–11.3) – 8.8% (95% CI: 5.8–12.3). Sub-group analysis found that the prevalence of L. hongkongensis was highest in Amphibian (54.6%, 95% CI: 41.3–67.6), followed by Pisces (7.9%, 95% CI: 5.3–10.9), Avian (0.5%, 95% CI: 0–5.8), and Mammal (0.5%, 95% CI: 0–3.6). In addition, Egger’s regression-test of funnel plot suggests presence of publication (z = 4.2, p < 0.0001) in mammal subgroup. Multivariate meta-regression showed that the prevalence was significantly influenced by source type, class, and identification/detection method with the source type, class, and detection method specifically accounted for 25.49%, 11.28%, and 3.84% of the heterogeneity, respectively. Conclusively, the prevalence of L. hongkongensis decrease in order of Amphibian (54.6%), Pisces (7.9%), Avian (0.5%) and Mammal (0.5%). Aquatic products and environments are essential sources of the pathogen.##True#13.07.2022 00:00:00#12.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

201#F-2022-357#Bacillus cytotoxicus#Bacillus cytotoxicus is a member of the Bacillus cereus group. This group comprises closely related organisms of varying pathogenicity including the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus sensu stricto. Some members of the B. cereus group can cause two distinct forms of food-borne illness: Firstly, the diarrheal syndrome that is linked to three enterotoxins - Hbl, Nhe and CytK - and secondly, the emetic syndrome caused by cereulide toxin preformed in food. B. cytotoxicus was isolated for the first time in the context of a severe outbreak of diarrheal disease leading to fatalities and was described as a species in 2013. The organism harbors a specific variant of the gene encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin K designated cytK-1. It has been reported that the cytotoxin K variant CytK-1 confers substantially higher toxicity than CytK-2. B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and might be missed using routine diagnostic screening for B. cereus group organisms at 30°C. Targeted screening at temperatures of at least 37°C has shown that dried food matrices containing potato starch very commonly harbor B. cytotoxicus.For instance, a recent study found a prevalence of 95% in mashed potato powder sold at retail level in Switzerland. Recent reports from the UK suggest that B. cytotoxicus also occurs in association with insect-based foods, which have recently gained popularity. In cytotoxicity assays, the few B. cytotoxicus strains that have been characterized to date range from non-toxic to extremely toxic, with toxicity surpassing the toxicity of a B. cereus outbreak strain (NVH 0075-95) used as a reference. Information on B. cytotoxicus is still limited and it is unclear if the organism’s capacity to germinate, produce enterotoxins, and exhibit cytotoxic effects in the intestine is comparable to that of B. cereus.B. cytotoxicus is a Gram-positive, aerobic organism able to produce spores. The species description was based on five strains, four of which were linked to foodborne disease (Guinebretière et al., 2013). B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and able to grow at temperatures of up to 53°C. Further characteristic features are the absence of starch hydrolysis and the dependency from tryptophan for growth. B. cytotoxicus also characteristically harbors the cytK-1 variant of the cytotoxin K gene.#`The B. cytotoxicus outbreak in a nursing home in France in 1998 had been caused by vegetable puree that exhibited 3.0 x10E5 CFU of B. cytotoxicus per gram food. A total of 44 cases were reported, with six patients suffering from bloody diarrhea and with three fatalities due to necrotic enteritis, making this outbreak the most severe B. cereus s.l. related outbreak in France (Cairo et al., 2021). The B. cytotoxicus outbreak in a nursing home in France in 1998 had been caused by vegetable puree that exhibited 3.0 x10E5 CFU of B. cytotoxicus per gram food.

202#F-2022-358#Ostreopsis - a new algae at European coasts#`In the summer of 2021, a new and unexpected phenomenon on the beaches of the Basque Country occured: a clinical picture reminiscent of an influenza-like syndrome, affecting entire families but also beach professionals (lifeguards, beach restaurant waiters, etc.). Water samples taken showed a high concentration of a microalga not visible to the naked eye called Ostreopsis. No serious cases were observed out of the 674 cases reported to the authorities in Bordeaux. Climate change and human activities are causing changes in the marine environment. It is in this context that new intoxications are appearing. These microalgae, invisible to the naked eye, grow on macroalgae and on the sea bed.They can also contaminate fish and shellfish through bioaccumulation.The particularity of Ostreopsis spp. is that it emits toxins in seawater and in particular at the level of the blooms. They are then aerosolised in the sea spray. One can therefore be intoxicated by the respiratory route without having set a foot into the water, through the skin when swimming, but also by ingestion when consuming contaminated products.

These microalgae produce toxins similar to palytoxin, responsible for :
Neurological signs: tingling, burning and headaches
ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and respiratory signs: runny nose, coughing, breathing difficulties,
Skin signs resembling urticaria,
Cardiac signs: tachycardia, high blood pressure,
Digestive signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
General signs: fever, muscle and joint pain.
`#On 5 August 2021, the Territorial Poison Control Centre in France received a call for a sudden flu-like syndrome during a swim, suggesting Ostreopsis spp. poisoning. The investigation showed that the first intoxications had occurred in July. The samples taken made it possible to quickly identify Ostreospsis siamensis. A total of 830 alerts were received and recorded. The entire Basque coast was affected.All patients recovered within two (acute exposure) to seven days (subacute exposure). There were no deaths or even severe cases.#True#21.07.2022 00:00:00#15.09.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`--- Primary ---

211#F-2022-367#Surrogate dairy products#Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.##True#04.10.2022 00:00:00#17.09.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20#`2022

212#F-2022-368#Tara flour behind mysterious illness#An online vegan food company says it has discovered the ingredient in one of its products that has been making consumers severely ill. Symptoms included severe gastrointestinal distress and highly elevated level of liver enzymes. Several consumers needed to have their gallbladders removed as a result. The company announced that it had identified the culprit in the French lentil & leek crumbles: Tara flour, made from the seeds of tara trees.#The FDA has determined that tara flour does not meet the criteria for generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, classifying its use in food as an unapproved food additive that renders the food adulterated. This decision follows a recall by Daily Harvest in June 2022 due to serious adverse events linked to tara flour consumption, including liver toxicity and hospitalizations. The FDA's assessment highlights the lack of sufficient scientific data on tara flour's composition and effects, with studies suggesting potential liver toxicity. The agency also found no evidence of tara flour being consumed in food before 1958, a requirement for a GRAS conclusion based on common use in food; https://natlawreview.com/article/fda-concludes-tara-flour-not-gras (17.05.2024)#True#29.09.2022 00:00:00#29.06.2024 00:00:00#10#true#20#`2017

Podcast Maintenance Phase: The Daily Harvest Food Poisoning Scandal on Apple Podcasts
FDA says tara flour was likely behind illnesses tied to Daily Harvest crumbles (Food Safety News, 17.02.2023): "Based on component ingredient analysis, FDA identified tara protein flour and sacha inchi powder as ingredients of interest. The FDA tested individual ingredients, including tara flour, for the crumbles and found toxic metals. The toxic metals screen included the following metals above the reporting limit (200 ng/g): vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, selenium, cadmium, mercury, thallium, and lead.Comment: Based on the lack of information on the type and quantity of alkaloids in the third country (TF), EFSA concludes that the TF may pose a risk to human health. Thus, EFSA raises safety objections to the placing on the market within the EU of the TF (i.e. roasted seeds from Plukenetia volubilis L.).

214#F-2022-370#Alongshan-Virus (ALSV) #The ALS virus, first discovered in China in 2017, is a member of the flavivirus family along with the TBE virus. After being bitten by ticks, several patients suffered from fever and headaches – the typical symptoms of a TBE infection. And yet, no antibodies against the TBE virus or its genetic material could be detected in the affected individuals. Instead, the researchers found a previously unknown RNA virus, the Alongshan virus. The complete gene sequence of ALS viruses was found in numerous tick samples collected in several regions of Switzerland in 2021 and 2022. “Surprisingly, ALS viruses were detected in the tick samples far more frequently than TBE viruses,” says Cornel Fraefel, director of the Institute of Virology. Since the symptoms of an infection with ALS viruses are similar to those of an infection with TBE viruses, the Alongshan virus could already pose a public health concern in Switzerland, albeit hitherto unrecognized. At present a possible transmission also via milk, like TBE, is not known.#In numerous tick samples collected in several regions of Switzerland in 2021 and 2022, the researchers found the complete gene sequence of ALS viruses. "We were surprised that we were able to detect ALS viruses in the tick samples far more frequently than TBE viruses." researchers said. Since the symptoms of an infection with ALS viruses are similar to those of an infection with TBE viruses, the Alongshan virus could already be relevant for public health in Switzerland - even if unrecognised.#True#13.12.2022 00:00:00#13.12.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`2019

215#F-2022-371#Impact of rising gas prices on CO2 availability and electricity used in food industry#`There is likely to be a shortage of CO2 throughout Europe over the next months, which is likely to have an impact on the food and beverage industry. This appears to be arising due to reductions in fertiliser manufacture (due to gas price increases) of which carbon dioxide is a by-product. This fact sheet will highlight the food safety issues which may arise as food business operators try to manage their CO2 and electricity supply. CO2 is a gas that is used extensively in the food and beverage industry for a variety of food purposes, such as adding bubbles to beer and soft drinks, drinks dispensing systems, livestock stunning gas and extension of shelf-life of foods with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The potential impact of the sharp increase in electricity prices and possible supply shutdowns on food safety are also discussed.

216#F-2022-372#Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) as natural food supplement#`Inonotus obliquus, is a fungus which is growing on trunks of birch and alder trees. In english it is called "chaga". It is a popular health product, with claimed therapeutic action. It is claimed to be rich in vitamins and minerals. In Estonia chaga products (pieces, powder, extracts in alcohol or water) are on the market, with more than 60 products and more than 20 producers. There is a search for export markets. Inonotus obliquus is marketed as a healthy lifestyle product, superfood and universal medicine suitable for everyone. Estonia did some analysis and concluded based on these results: 

If chaga is consumed in recommended quantities, the contents of aluminium and heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni, Pb, Sn) don’t pose health risk for adults
The oxalate contents (up to 80% of ADI) may induce the risk of kidney stones or nephropathy in adults
Due to the smaller body weigt of children: 

Possible health risks due to Ni and Pb
The exposure to Al and Cd contribute a major part of TWI
The exposure to oxalates may reach up to 352% of ADI


The concentrations of minerals are generally small (below 10% of NRV)

217#F-2022-373#Tert-butylhydroquinone#Tert-butylhydroquinone (also known as TBHQ, E319) is an organic compound belonging to the polyhydric phenol family and is a derivative of hydroquinone containing a terc-butyl group. TBHQ is a preservative found in many foods, including edible oils, frozen meats (especially fish) and processed foods such as crisps and biscuits. TBHQ do not always have to be listed in the ingredients list. It has been used in food for many decades, it has no other function than to increase the shelf life of the product, as an antioxidant it prevents the oxidation of fats. In 2021, a study by the US Environmental Working Group (EWG), analysing data from Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast), showed that the preservative TBHQ is harmful to the immune system, based on both animal studies and in vitro toxicology studies. This finding is particularly worrying in the time of the coronavirus pandemic. The EWG recommends that immunotoxicity testing of chemicals in food and food contact materials should be prioritised to protect public health from their potential adverse effects on the immune system.##True#19.12.2022 00:00:00#02.12.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`2004-2020:

222#F-2023-005#Protein supplements : effects of a (too) high protein diet#"A high protein intake is great for losing weight, but it's also great for athletes." With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more "high protein" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this "high protein" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the "healthy" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of "if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite "high protein" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly.  In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.##True#27.01.2023 00:00:00#02.03.2025 00:00:00#30#true#20#`

223#F-2023-006#Encapsulation Systems for Antimicrobial Food Packaging Components#Antimicrobial active packaging has emerged as an effective technology to reduce microbialgrowth in food products increasing both their shelf-life and microbial safety for the consumer while maintaining their quality and sensorial properties. In the last years, a great effort has been made to develop more efficient, long-lasting and eco-friendly antimicrobial materials by improvingthe performance of the incorporated antimicrobial substances. With this purpose, more effective antimicrobial compounds of natural origin such as bacteriocins, bacteriophages and essential oils have been preferred over synthetic ones and new encapsulation strategies such as emulsions, core-shell nanofibres, cyclodextrins and liposomes among others, have been applied in order to protect these antimicrobials from degradation or volatilization while trying to enable a more controlled release and sustained antimicrobial action. This trend brought new challenges regarding the incorporation of these new products into these novel packaging materials in terms of antimicrobial-packaging material compatibilities and, the most important one, the decreased stability of these natural-based compounds as they are more prone to suffer degradation by heat and light. Furthermore, there are other losses to be faced when incorporating some of these antimicrobials in packaging materials due to their inherent volatilization.##True#30.01.2023 00:00:00#30.01.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20#`

Antimicrobial Nanomaterials for Food Packaging - PMC (nih.gov) (29.06.2022) : "Aside from the numerous benefits of nanomaterials to the food industry, safety concerns about nanomaterials must not be overlooked. Many researchers explored nanomaterial safety concerns, focusing on the risk of nanoparticles migrating from packaging material into food and their influence on consumer health. Even if a substance is GRAS (generally regarded as safe), extra research is required to assess the risk of its nano equivalents since the physiochemical properties of nanostates differ significantly from those of macrostates. Furthermore, the small size of these nanomaterials may raise the danger of bioaccumulation within body organs and tissues [116]."

This survey of the Food Standards Scotland shows that the cost of living crisis is driving consumer behaviour with the potential to negatively impact public health.##True#14.02.2023 00:00:00#01.02.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`2023

227#F-2023-010#Irrigation with wastewater#As climatic changes are increasing the pressure on water resources and more fresh fruits and vegetables are needed to meet the demands of a growing population, growers may need to start depending on more varied sources of water for irrigation, including environmental, recycled, and reclaimed wastewaters. Additionally, the wastewater draining from massive pools of sewage sludge has the potential to play a role in more sustainable agriculture (Science of The Total Environment, 20.01.2023). However, this practice is not without risks as some of some of these wastewater sources might be susceptible to contamination with microbial pathogensFor instance, surveys have found Listeria monocytogenes in water, soil, vegetation, and farm animal feces around the world. The frequency at which this pathogen is present in water sources is dependent on multiple factors, including the season, surrounding land use, presence of animals, and physicochemical water parameters. Understanding the survival duration of L. monocytogenes in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors. Understanding the pathogen’s ability to remain infectious is key to understanding how L. monocytogenes impacts produce outbreaks and, ultimately, consumers’ health.Moreover, the German federal institute for risk assessment (BfR) has published a risk assessment of transmission of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Toxoplasma gondii to humans related to using reclaimed wastewater in agriculture where they recommend to only use irrigation water of a quality comparable to drinking water for watering plants that are usually consumed raw.##True#28.02.2023 00:00:00#01.10.2024 00:00:00#40#true#20#`

230#F-2023-013#Grayanotoxin in honey#The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific opinion on the risks for human health of the presence of grayanotoxins (GTXs) in ‘certain honey’ from Ericaceae plants. The risk assessment included all structurally related grayananes occurring with GTXs in ‘certain’ honey. Oral exposure is associated with acute intoxication in humans. Acute symptoms affect the muscles, nervous and cardiovascular systems. These may lead to complete atrioventricular block, convulsions, mental confusion, agitation, syncope and respiratory depression. For acute effects, the CONTAM Panel derived a reference point (RP) of 15.3 μg/kg body weight for the sum of GTX I and III based on a BMDL10 for reduced heart rate in rats. A similar relative potency was considered for GTX I. Without chronic toxicity studies, an RP for long-term effects could not be derived. There is evidence for genotoxicity in mice exposed to GTX III or honey containing GTX I and III, showing increased levels of chromosomal damage. The mechanism of genotoxicity is unknown. Without representative occurrence data for the sum of GTX I and III and consumption data from Ericaceae honey, acute dietary exposure was estimated based on selected concentrations for GTX I and III reflecting concentrations measured in ‘certain’ honeys. Applying a margin of exposure (MOE) approach, the estimated MOEs raised health concerns for acute toxicity. The Panel calculated the highest concentrations for GTX I and III below which no acute effects would be expected following ‘certain honey’ consumption. The Panel is 75% or more certain that the calculated highest concentration of 0.05 mg for the sum of GTX I and III per kg honey is protective for all age groups regarding acute intoxications. This value does not consider other grayananes in ‘certain honey’ and does not cover the identified genotoxicity.##True#06.03.2023 00:00:00#01.03.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20#`

233#F-2023-016#Social media and food safety risk#Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.##True#13.03.2023 00:00:00#01.01.2025 00:00:00#50#true#20#`------------------------------------- Scientific literature  -------------------------------------2022

235#F-2023-018#Detrimental impact of cellulose derivatives food additive on the gut microbiota#Additive derivated from cellulose - such as microcrystalline cellulose (E 460), powdered cellulose (E 460), methyl cellulose (E 461), ethyl cellulose (E 462), hydroxypropyl cellulose (E 463), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (E 464), ethyl methyl cellulose (E 465), sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (E 466) and enzymatically hydrolysed carboxy methyl cellulose (E 469) - are often used in the food industry because of thier thechnological properties. However, since several years, these additives are controversial because of their potential adverse health effects. The EFSA stated in 2018 that they would be no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels for the unmodified and modified celluloses. However, results of a randomized Controlled-Feeding Study of Dietary Emulsifier Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) published in 2021 support the notion that the broad use of CMC in processed foods may be contributing to increased prevalence of an array of chronic inflammatory diseases by altering the gut microbiome and metabolome. Because these additives are commonly used in meat-alternatives and regular consumer of these product would be more exposed to these additives, increasing the risk of developing inflammatory diseases.##True#20.04.2023 00:00:00#25.04.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20#`

236#F-2023-019#Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria#Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.#Results suggest that the prevalence of mobile ARGs might not be negligible, it might be worthy to consider the development of guidelines to monitor these mobile ARGs.#True#29.04.2023 00:00:00#26.01.2025 00:00:00#10#true#20#`

238#F-2023-021#The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety#The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.#In May 2023, for example, a US lawyer admitted using ChatGPT for case research. The lawyer’s filing was found to reference legal cases that didn’t exist. The chatbot had made them up. It’s not the first time that these “AI hallucinations” have been reported.

245#F-2023-028#Is it safe to cook with essential oils?#Essential oils, which are extracted from plants, are best known for their use in aromatherapy, a complementary health practice that involves inhaling the scents or mixing the oils with lotion or massage oil. There has been a growing interest in other uses for these oils, however, including using them for cooking. In addition to irritating and burning the tissues of the mouth and esophagus, consuming essential oils directly can cause seizures, hallucinations, and coma. A study published in 2019 in The Medical Journal of Australia reported that toxicity from ingesting essential oils is on the rise, and “increasing frequency and severity of essential oil poisonings have been reported in Europe and the United States. Some essential oils have been linked to adverse effects when ingested, even in tiny amounts. These are particularly: Eucalyptus Oil, Sage Oil, Wintergreen Oil.#There is a lot of hype about using essential oils in the kitchen. There are various recipes (e.g. Claudia Brock Cooking and Baking with Essential Oils) and many more can be found on the internet.

250#F-2023-033#Dimethylated Thioarsenates in rice#Arsenic (As) occurrence in rice is a serious human health threat. Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: Open EFSA (europa.eu))##True#09.11.2023 00:00:00#10.11.2024 00:00:00#10#false#20#`2022

255#F-2024-003#Alcohol replacement drinks#A company called GABA labs is working on alcohol replacements. The Sentia botanical drink is made with food grade herbs that contain molecules that work on the GABA system, which produces a state of relaxation and sociality. By targeting the GABA system, the drink avoids targeting other neurotransmitter systems that alcohol affects, which can lead to problems when larger doses are consumed. The use of these herbs is believed to minimize the risk of dependence, as they are not known to activate the dopamine system, which is a key driver of alcohol dependence and craving. Alcarelle, a synthetic molecule targets subtypes of the GABA system to mimic the effects of alcohol in a more specific way. The goal is to license Alcarelle as an ingredient that can be used extensively as an alternative to alcohol by any drink company in the world. The molecule is designed to offer the pleasure of alcohol with less harm and a lot fewer calories.#A new wave of drinks designed to mimic alcohol's effects, but without the hangover or dependency; EFSA: Recreational substances/products are starting to appear in novel food assessments.

257#F-2024-005#Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood#The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another study found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.#The central question is : What is the situation like in Switzerland and can it pose a threat to the Swiss population?#True#09.02.2024 00:00:00#15.03.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`2019:

258#F-2024-006#Energy costs : three degrees of change in frozen food#Food freezing, as a form of preservation, extends product shelf life without detriment to food safety for months while also offering built-in opportunities to optimise utilisation through scheduled consumption. Research has demonstrated that frozen foods results in 47% less household food waste than fresh food categories (Martindale 2014). However, with frozen foods comes a significant energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions challenge to the success of a transition to sustainable coldchains: it is energy intensive to freeze foods and hold them at a sub-zero temperature.  Currently the industry standard set-point is -18°C or lower: a temperature established in the mid-20th century which provides a good margin of safety. Some in the industry think a standard set-point of -15°C would be more appropriate for certain food products and that a requirement to not ‘over-freeze’ could be introduced - without any significant negative impacts on food safety or quality. The change in this temperature could be valuable in the context of reducing the increase in energy demand and GHG emissions from the sector. It would also deliver a substantial commercial benefit to cold-chain operators through reduced energy costs. The central question is : Does increasing the temperature of frozen food storage from -18°C to -15°C pose a risk to food safety, particularly in terms of parasite survival?#The Move To Minus 15°C | Cold Chain Sustainability#True#09.02.2024 00:00:00#30.06.2024 00:00:00#20#true#20#`2021-2022

H. pullorum naturally infects many poultry birds, some rodent species, and also humans. , it has been isolated from the feces of human patients with enteritis as well as healthy humans. H. pullorum is associated with several clinically significant infections in humans , such as colitis and hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, recurrent diarrhea, and bacteremia . H. pullorum is also thought to play an important role in the development of Crohn’s disease.  Helicobacter pullorum is an emerging foodborne pathogen that commonly colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of poultry, causing gastroenteritis.  The bacterium may be transmitted to humans through undercooked poultry meat.##True#11.03.2024 00:00:00#11.03.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20####2024-03-11T06:34:37#84#2024-03-12T09:33:43#932#2#12.03.2024 09:33:43#2024-03-11#2024-03-12
262#F-2024-010#Ruminococcus gnavus#Ruminococcus gnavus was first identified in 1974 as a strict anaerobe in the gut of healthy individuals, and for several decades, its study has been limited to specific enzymes or bacteriocins. With the advent of metagenomics, R. gnavus has been associated both positively and negatively with an increasing number of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases from inflammatory bowel diseases to neurological disorders. This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years.##True#11.03.2024 00:00:00#11.03.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20####2024-03-11T08:23:28#84#2024-03-12T09:37:28#932#1#12.03.2024 09:37:28#2024-03-11#2024-03-12
263#F-2024-011#Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen#Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.##True#14.03.2024 00:00:00#14.03.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20####2024-03-14T08:26:04#84#2024-03-15T10:20:57#932#1#15.03.2024 10:20:57#2024-03-14#2024-03-15
264#F-2024-012#Alternaria spp. mycotoxins in vegetables#The plant disease cabbage blight in cabbage plants (Brassicaceae), e.g. cauliflower and broccoli, is caused by infestation with the fungal species Alternaria brassicae and A. brassicicola. Alternaria spp. also infest other vegetables, namely tomatoes. They produce mycotoxins, with the 'big 5', namely alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT), being particularly problematic. These toxins have been detected in cauliflower. Other toxins are known. No maximum levels have been set for these toxins in food across Europe. The problem is being addressed; the focus of interest so far has been on tomatoes [1,2,3]. The first symptoms of cauliflower infestation are the formation of small black dots on the surface of an inflorescence. The FSVO does not consider such an incipient infestation to be a health concern. It cannot be assumed that an incipient infestation (visible through individual black dots on the surface) is accompanied by a contamination of the entire inflorescence that is hazardous to health. However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested. The question arises as to how the infestation progresses in cabbage vegetables, whose tissue is relatively firm, and whether there is a correlation between visible symptoms and a potential health risk. Such findings could contribute to better consumer protection.##True#08.04.2024 00:00:00#01.01.2025 00:00:00#40#true#20#`[1]  EFSA, 2016 Dietary exposure assessment to Alternaria toxins in the European population.EFSA J  [2]  EFSA, 2011 Scientific Opinion on the risks for animal and public health related to the presence of Alternaria toxins in feed and food.

266#F-2024-014#Poor diet increases cancer risk - scientists uncover missing link#A research team has unearthed new findings which may help explain the connection between cancer risk and poor diet, as well as common diseases like diabetes, which arise from poor diet. The insights gained from this study hold promise for advancing cancer prevention strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging. Poor diet can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. However, experts have not yet found any firm causative links between individual dietary components and cancer. A new study has discovered that methylglyoxal — which is produced when glucose is broken down in cells — may help explain the link between poor diet and cancer. They suggest that a long-term poor diet leads to an increase in the production of methylglyoxal, which switches off cancer-preventing genes, increasing cancer risk.#Manuka honey has an increased level of methylglyoxal. #True#23.04.2024 00:00:00#23.04.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20####2024-04-23T07:23:40#84#2024-04-23T15:58:30#932#2#23.04.2024 15:58:30#2024-04-23#2024-04-23
268#F-2024-016#Neotam#An artificial sweetener called neotame can cause significant harm to the gut.  It does this harm in two ways. One, by breaking down the layer of cells that line the intestine. And, two, by causing previously healthy gut bacteria to become diseased, resulting in them invading the gut wall. Neotame was developed as an alternative to aspartame with the aim of being a more stable and sweet version of the traditional sweetener. It is very stable at high temperatures, which means it is a good additive to use in baked goods. It is also used in soft drinks and chewing gum. Neotame has been approved for use in more than 35 countries, including the UK, although the European Food Safety Agency is currently reviewing the sweetener as part of a series of evidence‐based risk assessments of certain sweeteners. While neotame has been shown to change the profile of gut bacteria, very little research has investigated the effect of neotame at the cellular level.##True#29.04.2024 00:00:00#29.04.2025 00:00:00#10#false#20#`2024

This goes hand in hand with the emergence of new trendy recipes or harvests. As these shellfish are not well known, they could harbour new pathogens and become a new threat to the population. For instance, in a study conducted in China, C. perfringens from aquatic source showed a high isolation rate, notably in cooked clams. C. perfringens toxin type G in clams was detected for the first time and the toxin genes cpb, cpe, and netB were detected for the first time in cooked clams.  The average antibiotic resistance rates of the strains to tetracycline, clindamycin, and ampicillin were 45 %, 20 %, and 16 % respectively.##True#02.07.2024 00:00:00#10.07.2025 00:00:00#10#true#20#`

272#F-2024-020#Food safety in refrigerators#Food safety issues caused by cryogenic microorganisms during storage in domestic in domestic refrigerators have attracted widespread attention. Diversity of foods, such as raw and cooked meats, seafood, rice and flour products, vegetables and fruit, etc. as well as the abundance of nutrients, have become the best habitat for the growth and reproduction of cryogenic micro-organisms in the refrigerator. In addition, the colonisation of cryogenic microorganisms on the inside wall of the refrigerator is difficult to remove and eliminate, which will further affect the quality and further compromise the quality and safety of food stored in the refrigerator and may cause outbreaks of foodborne illness. In this review, the the storage location of different foods in the refrigerator, the types of organisms that commonly organisms that commonly contaminate foods in the refrigerator, and are comprehensively described. A survey conducted in Switzerland showed that approximatively  25% of respondents who wanted to reduce their energy costs raised the fridge temperature. The population doing this was found to be mainly the older generation and therefore part of the vulnerable population. This study is consistent with the results of another study conducted in the Netherlands. A survey among 1,020 Dutch consumers assessed their knowledge and behavior regarding refrigerators. The mean temperature of 534 domestic refrigerators on the bottom shelf was 5.7 °C. Outcomes of the survey were used to estimate the number of listeriosis cases per year due to consumption of RTE-cooked meat products among different population risk groups. The study showed that the more extreme high storage conditions were found in refrigerators of the elderly, and this indicates that there is a need for more targeted communication about good storage practices. Due to demographic changes, rising temperatures and the constant increase in energy prices, we might expect more and more outbreaks. Therefore, risk communication tailored to vulnerable groups could help to reduce the risks.#Due to demographic changes, rising temperatures and the constant increase in energy prices, we might expect more and more outbreaks.
