It is a popular health product, with claimed therapeutic action. It is claimed to be rich in vitamins and minerals. In Estonia chaga products (pieces, powder, extracts in alcohol or water) are on the market, with more than 60 products and more than 20 producers. There is a search for export markets. Inonotus obliquus is marketed as a healthy lifestyle product, superfood and universal medicine suitable for everyone. Estonia did some analysis and concluded based on these results: 

If chaga is consumed in recommended quantities, the contents of aluminium and heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni, Pb, Sn) don’t pose health risk for adults
The oxalate contents (up to 80% of ADI) may induce the risk of kidney stones or nephropathy in adults
Due to the smaller body weigt of children: 

Possible health risks due to Ni and Pb
The exposure to Al and Cd contribute a major part of TWI
The exposure to oxalates may reach up to 352% of ADI


The concentrations of minerals are generally small (below 10% of NRV)

414#N-2023-196#Widespread occurence of quaternary alkylammonium disinfectants in soils of Hesse, Germany#Quaternary alkylammonium compounds (QAACs) are cationic organic compounds with amphiphilic properties thatare widely used as surfactants and disinfectants in industry, households and agriculture. Several studies suggest thatQAACs co-select for antibiotic resistant microorganisms and thus may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistancein the environment. Data on QAAC occurrence in soil are scarce and limited to soils that are prone to direct exposure toQAACs. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study on the occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesse, a federal statein Germany, covering an area of 21,115 km2. Sixty-five soil samples that comprised different land uses (arable, grass-land, forest, vineyard) and area types (rural, agglomeration) were analysed for concentrations ofalkyltrimethylammonium (ATMACs, with alkyl chain lengths C8-C16), benzylalkyldimethylammonium (BACs, C8-C18) and dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs, C8-C18) via HPLC-MS/MS after ultrasonic-assisted ex-traction with acidified acetonitrile. QAACs were detected in 97 % of the soil samples irrespective of land use and areatype. The most abundant QAAC homologues were DADMACs > BACs > ATMACs. The highest total QAAC concentra-tions were detected in alluvial soils influenced by the deposition of suspended particles during flood events, withDADMAC-C16 and -C18 as the dominant homologues. The high abundance of long-chain DADMACs suggests that leg-acy pollution and accumulation govern QAAC concentrations in soils. The presence of QAACs in forest soils points to apotential input via atmospheric deposition. Our work highlights the widespread occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesseand the need for more research on their entry paths and fate in the soil ecosystem.#Might have - beside other quaternary ammonium compounds - impact into drinking water safety and soil dependent vegetable cultures#True#0#False##20#2023-04-04T06:48:04#971#2023-04-04T11:06:48#932#2#04.04.2023 11:06:48#2023-04-04#2023-04-04

Officials are concerned that added vitamins, minerals, caffeine, or other substances in the beverages may pose a health risk for consumers.   Certain quantities of vitamins, minerals, and other substances can be added to various foods and beverages. If they are not already permitted, the business must apply for approval. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority then assesses whether the added items may pose a health risk before a permit is granted.   The agency said so far it has not received applications from importers with the necessary information about Prime products. Some flavors have a higher caffeine content than is permitted under current regulations. Others have a high amount of vitamin A, which people can get in sufficient quantities from other foods. Excessive intake of vitamin A over a long period can damage the liver.   The Norwegian Food Safety Authority said importers are responsible for the safety of goods they bring into the country and must ensure products meet the relevant regulations.   In Denmark, the sale of such products without notification is not allowed.   The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) said it has found Prime drinks illegally sold online via websites such as Facebook. The agency recently banned sales of the drinks from five registered and unregistered companies. Efforts are part of an ongoing control campaign, where companies’ sales of items that include added vitamins, minerals or certain other substances are being checked.   The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said it had been approached by parents who asked if the drink was safe for their children.   If Prime products have added substances or amounts of additives that are not pre-approved, then they must go through an approval process but authorities said this hasn’t happened. If the drinks comply with the rules for added quantities, importers can register them so they can be legally sold in Denmark.#The product may be found/sold also in Switzerland: Buy Prime Hydration Products Online at Best Prices | Ubuy Switzerland (u-buy.ch)#True#1#False##20#2023-05-17T07:36:14#84#2023-05-23T08:13:40#932#1#23.05.2023 08:13:40#2023-05-17#2023-05-23

Cholera is mainly caused by cholera toxin (CT) producing toxigenic O1 and O139 serogroup Vibrio cholerae strains. While most toxigenic V. cholerae cases in Australia are thought to be caused by international-acquired infections, Australia has its own indigenous toxigenic and non-toxigenic O1 and non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae (NOVC) strains. In Australia, in the 1970s and again in 2012, it was reported that south-east Queensland riverways were a reservoir for toxigenic V. cholerae strains that were linked to local cases. Further surveillance on environmental reservoirs, such as riverways, has not been reported in the literature in the last 10 years. Here we present data from sites previously related to outbreaks and surveillance sampling to detect the presence of V. cholerae using PCR in conjunction with MALDI-TOF and whole-genome sequencing. In this study, we were able to detect NOVC at all 10 sites with all sites having toxigenic non-O1, non-O139 strains. Among 133 NOVC isolates, 22 were whole-genome sequenced and compared with previously sequenced Australian O1 and NOVC strains. None of the samples tested grew toxigenic or non-toxigenic O1 or O139, responsible for epidemic disease. Since NOVC can be pathogenic, continuous surveillance is required to assist in theclinical and envir rapid identification of sources of any outbreaks and to assist public health authorities in implementing control measures.##True#2#False##20#2023-10-09T07:47:19#84#2023-10-11T16:40:23#932#1#11.10.2023 16:40:23#2023-10-09#2023-10-11

They found spikes in nutrient concentrations immediately after extreme precipitation events, and the effect increased with the amount of precipitation.#Nutrient pollution is the process where too many nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, are added to bodies of water and can act like fertilizer, causing excessive growth of algae. Nutrients can run off of land in urban areas where lawn and garden fertilizers are used. Nutrients can lead to a massive overgrowth of algae, known as an algae  bloom. Certain types of algae emit toxins that are absorbed by shellfish; consuming these tainted shellfish can lead to stomach illness and shortterm memory problems. Drinking or coming into contact with toxins from algae blooms can cause stomach aches, rashes and more serious problems. Excess nitrogen is a common drinking water contaminant in agricultural areas and can pose particular risk to infants younger than six months old. Chemicals used to treat nutrient-polluted drinking water can pose additional risks to human health. These chemicals, including chlorine, can react with the algae in the water to form disinfection by-products that have been associated with reproductive and developmental health problems. Nitrogen pollutants in the air from burning fossil fuels can contribute to a variety of respiratory problems for children, the elderly and those with lung ailments.#True#2#False##20#2023-12-12T07:31:49#932#2024-01-17T10:35:00#932#2#12.12.2023 16:52:25#2023-12-12#2024-01-17

Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages (CABs) were premixed beverages popular in the 2000s that combined alcohol, caffeine, and other stimulants.
CABs were heavily marketed in youth-friendly media (e.g., social media) and with youth-oriented graphics and messaging that connected the consumption of these beverages with extreme sports or their risk-taking behaviors.
In November 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told the manufacturers of seven CABs that their drinks could no longer stay on the market in their current form, stating that “FDA does not find support for the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is ‘generally recognized as safe,’ which is the legal standard.” Producers of CABs responded by removing caffeine and other stimulants from their products.

1179#N-2024-178#Confronting Views of Companies and Authorities on Food Safety Issues—A Cross-Country Survey#This study investigated food safety issues as perceived by food companies and food safety authorities in six countries in Europe and Central Asia. A total of 66 companies and 16 authorities participated in the survey. The results provide important insights related to what the main food safety priorities are, how they are addressed in the countries that participated in the survey, and what the role of the main stakeholders is in the food value chain. Almost 50% of food companies identified ‘food fraud’ as the most influential food safety attribute. One-third of food safety authorities recognized ‘food safety management system’ as the most influential food safety attribute. Principal component analysis separated food safety statements into two dimensions named ‘food safety hazards and risks’ and ‘food safety system’. Although there are slight differences in food safety statements between the two stakeholders, i.e., food companies and food safety authorities, it is the country of origin that plays a more important role in understanding their views. Food companies will need to implement a systemic approach and transform the entire food value chain continuum while considering new food safety challenges. It is expected that food safety authorities will have to play a more proactive role in the future.##True#1#False##20#2024-03-04T07:20:31#84#2024-03-05T06:57:50#932#1#05.03.2024 06:57:50#2024-03-04#2024-03-05

Incorporating micro- and macroalgae into meat products presents an exciting possibility for the meat sector to develop functional food, given that they serve as excellent natural sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds. This review aims to systematically outline the impact of incorporating whole algae and their extracts into various meat products, examining their effects on quality, physicochemical and functional properties, sensory characteristics, and potential for enhancing shelf life. Adding algae to meat products generally increased pH values, with variations influenced by concentration, type, initial pH, and storage time. The protein content was mainly unaffected, except for Nori and Chlorella. Algae contributed to lower moisture and higher ash content due to dietary fiber. While including algae improved water-holding capacity and decreased cooking loss, it often led to increased hardness and chewiness. Algae and their extracts influenced color attributes, with variations based on the algae type. Sensory properties were distinctively affected, generally reducing overall acceptability, although Sea tangle at concentrations of 1–3% showed acceptable scores. Chlorella and Sea tangle positively impacted microbiology during refrigerated storage, while algae and their extracts demonstrated strong antioxidant activity.#The introduction of new ingredients, such as algae, can change the physico-chemical properties of the food, making it more favourable for pathogens to grow due to a higher pH or lower salt content.#True#1#False##20#2024-03-08T07:27:52#84#2024-03-11T10:21:25#932#1#11.03.2024 10:21:25#2024-03-08#2024-03-11

Salmonellosis outbreaks typically occur during warmer months. However, most outbreaks associated with chocolate were in the cold season. Researchers said popular seasonal products such as chocolate Santa Clauses and Easter bunnies might be the reason for this finding. Potential explanations for children being mainly affected include this group being more susceptible to intestinal infections, person-to-person transmission being more common due to behaviors that increase germ exposure, and chocolate’s appeal to this demographic. All reported outbreaks were in high-income countries.#“This finding may be related, on the one hand, to the large availability of industrially produced food and, on the other hand, to the presence of effective outbreak detection and control networks in these countries. It is also conceivable that outbreaks detected in middle-income and low-income countries have not been reported.

1219#N-2024-218#Decline in the nutritional quality of foods#In the last sixty years, there has been an alarming decline in food quality and a decrease in a wide variety of nutritionally essential minerals and nutraceutical compounds in imperative fruits, vegetables, and food crops. The potential causes behind the decline in the nutritional quality of foods have been identified worldwide as chaotic mineral nutrient application, the preference for less nutritious cultivars/crops, the use of high-yielding varieties, and agronomic issues associated with a shift from natural farming to chemical farming. Likewise, the rise in atmospheric or synthetically elevated carbon dioxide could contribute to the extensive reductions in the nutritional quality of fruits, vegetables, and food crops. Since ancient times, nutrient-intense crops such as millets, conventional fruits, and vegetables have been broadly grown and are the most important staple food, but the area dedicated to these crops has been declining steadily over the past few decades and hastily after the green revolution era due to their poorer economic competitiveness with major commodities such as high-yielding varieties of potato, tomato, maize, wheat, and rice. The majority of the population in underdeveloped and developing countries have lower immune systems, are severely malnourished, and have multiple nutrient deficiency disorders due to poor dietary intake and less nutritious foods because of ignorance about the importance of our traditional nutrient-rich diets and ecofriendly organic farming methods. This critical review emphasizes the importance of balance and adequate nutrition as well as the need to improve soil biodiversity and fertility: those are main causes behind the decline in nutritional density. There is also emphasis on a possible way out of alleviating the decline nutritional density of food crops for the health and well-being of future generations.##True#2#False##20#2024-03-15T07:05:33#84#2024-03-15T10:26:11#932#1#15.03.2024 10:26:11#2024-03-15#2024-03-15

1238#N-2024-237#Aichivirus (AiV)#There is a growing interest in understanding Aichivirus (AiV), particularly its mode  of transmission and clinical implications. The primary mode of transmission for AiV  is through the faecal-oral route, where the virus replicates in the cells of the  gastrointestinal (GI) tract. AiV infections often manifest with subclinical symptoms,  evidenced by a high prevalence of seroconversion but a low incidence of clinically  apparent disease. Symptoms associated with AiV infection are non-specific and  may include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Some cases  can be severe, leading to hospitalisation and extraintestinal complications such as  lower respiratory tract infections.  The importance of AiV as a cause of acute gastroenteritis varies across different  studies and settings. Testing of faecal samples has revealed a relatively low  incidence of AiV among cases of acute gastroenteritis, ranging from 0.9% to 4.1%  in various studies. Additionally, co-infection with other viruses is not uncommon,  occurring in 50-80% of cases in different studies. However, the significance of AiV  as a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis is highlighted in certain contexts. AiV  infections are widespread globally, with a high proportion of adults showing  seropositivity indicating exposure. Seropositivity rates typically increase with age,  with over 80% of individuals seropositive by age 40 in many regions. Infections  may occur in waves, with childhood and adolescence being common periods of  exposure. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) methods are commonly used to detect the presence of the virus in stool samples and vomitus, aiding in diagnosis and  surveillance efforts. However, information regarding the infective dose of AiV remains unknown.  AiV, is associated with foodborne illnesses, with shellfish being a confirmed vehicle,  although under-reporting is likely. Transmission via other foods and person-toperson contact is possible. AiV has been detected in raw and treated sewage as  well as surface and groundwater sources, suggesting potential waterborne  transmission pathways. However, the significance of food in AiV transmission  remains uncertain, highlighting the need for further research in this area.##True#1#False##20#2024-03-22T14:49:10#84#2024-04-08T11:39:16#932#1#08.04.2024 11:39:16#2024-03-22#2024-04-08

To determine if this STEC O157:H7 has greater potential for survival in kimchi than other STEC, the outbreak strain and six other STEC strains (O26:H11, O91:H21, O103:H2, O121:H19, and two O157:H7) were inoculated individually at 6 to 6.5 log CFU/g into commercially sourced kimchi and incubation at 4 °C. At intervals of seven days inoculated and control kimchi was plated onto MacConkey agar to enumerate lactose utilising bacteria. The colony counts were interpreted as enumerating the inoculated STEC, since no colonies were observed on MacConkey agar plated with uninoculated kimchi. Over eight weeks of incubation the pH was stable at 4.10 to 4.05 and the STEC strains declined by 0.7–1.0 log, with a median reduction of 0.9 log. The linear rate of reduction of kimchi outbreak STEC O157:H7 was −0.4 log per 30 days (Slope Uncertainty 0.05), which was not significantly different from the other O157 and nonO 157 STEC strains (P = 0.091).

It is known that the capacities to produce cereulide vary greatly between different strains but the genetic background of these variations is not clear.In this study, cereulide production capacities were associated with genetic characteristics. For this, cereulide levels in cultures of 31 strains were determined after incubation in tryptic soy broth for 24 h at 24 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C. Whole genome sequencing based data were used for an in-depth characterization of gene sequences related to cereulide production. The taxonomy, population structure and phylogenetic relationships of the strains were evaluated based on average nucleotide identity, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), core genome MLST and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses. Despite a limited strain number, the approach of a genome wide association study (GWAS) was tested to link genetic variation with cereulide quantities.Our study confirms strain-dependent differences in cereulide production. For most strains, these differences were not explainable by sequence variations in the cesHPTABCD gene cluster or the regulatory genes abrB, spo0A, codY and pagRBc.

1271#N-2024-270#Biodegradation of aged polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics by yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae)#Yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae) can biodegrade aged polyethylene (PE) film and polystyrene (PS) foam. After a 35-day feeding period, the larvae consumed both pristine and aged MPs. Although aged MPs inhibited larvae growth due to limited nutrient supply, they were depolymerized more efficiently in gut microbiota than pristine MPs. The metabolic intermediates of aged MPs contained more oxygen-containing functional groups and shortened long-chain alkane. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the richness and diversity of gut microbes were restricted in the MPs-fed group. Aged MPs may promote the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae. This study provides insights into insect-mediated mechanisms of aged MP degradation and potential strategies for sustainable and efficient MP management.##True#2#False##20#2024-04-08T07:34:22#84#2024-04-08T11:33:32#932#1#08.04.2024 11:33:32#2024-04-08#2024-04-08

Cold Foods: Always use at least two cold sources like frozen gel packs, frozen juice boxes, or frozen water bottles to keep foods cold. Foods that sit out at room temperature are at risk of entering the “Danger Zone” (temperatures between 5°C and 60°C where bacteria can multiply quickly and cause illness).
Hot Foods: When packing hot foods like chili, soups, or stews, make sure to use an insulated container to keep the food hot. Keep the container closed until lunchtime to keep the food at 60°C or above.

1381#N-2024-380#Microbiological safety of dry-aged meat#Dry-aged meat is gaining popularity among food business operators and private consumers. The process is carried out in aerobic conditions by hanging beef carcasses or placing subprimal or primal cuts in a dedicated cabinet for several weeks or even months while controlling the environment through the management of process parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and airflow. In this review, we present a critical evaluation of the literature to evaluate tools to manage the process to guarantee food safety and identify critical control points, as well as good hygienic and manufacturing practices. In controlled aging conditions, only Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica can multiply, while a reduction in the number of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 is generally reported. Enterobacteriaceae usually decrease on the surface of the meat during maturation; thus, for the purpose of the hygienic evaluation of the production process, a count no higher than that of unmatured meat is expected. Besides, various studies report that the total bacterial count and the spoilage microorganisms significantly increase on the surface of the meat, up to 5-6 Log CFU/g in the absence of visible spoilage. Bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus tend to progressively replace other microorganisms during maturation; thus, the total mesophilic or psychrophilic bacterial load is not a good indicator of process hygiene for matured meat. Critical parameters for the control of the process are temperature, relative humidity, and ventilation, which should be monitored during the process. For this reason, equipment designed and certified for dry aging must be used, and the manufacturer must validate the process. Food business operators must apply general good manufacturing practices (GMP) and good hygiene practices (GHP) for meat processing and some GMP and GHP specific for dry aging. Several research needs were identified, among them the evolution of the populations of L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica and the microbiology of the inner parts of the dry-aged meat.##True#1#False##20#2024-05-21T06:43:57#84#2024-05-22T14:40:56#932#1#22.05.2024 14:40:56#2024-05-21#2024-05-22

1587#N-2024-586#Human Aichivirus (AiV)#Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods. AiV belongs to the genus Kobuvirus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions. Furthermore, several studies conducted in Japan, Germany, France, Tunisia and Spain showed a high prevalence of AiV antibodies in adults (between 80% and 99%), which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus. The aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human Aichi virus (AiV), discussing the possibles routes of transmission, new detection techniques and future research. Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections. Further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of AiV in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide.##True#1#False##20#2024-08-23T10:18:14#84#2024-09-16T07:24:21#932#2#16.09.2024 07:24:21#2024-08-23#2024-09-16

The complete metagenome results showed a community with high diversity at the beginning and more restricted diversity at the end of the sampling, with a predominance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Most species were considered pathogenic, with an emphasis on those belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It was possible to identify bacterial groups of different threat levels to human health. The resistome analysis predominantly revealed genes that confer resistance to multiple drugs, followed by aminoglycosides and macrolides, with efflux pumps and drug inactivation being the most prevalent resistance mechanisms.

1712#N-2024-711#Are all ultra-processed foods equally bad for health?#A growing body of research has suggested that the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) has severe consequences for health, such as a higher rate of overall death causes, an increased risk of dementia, and the development of type 2 diabetes, among other complications. However, a new opinion paper suggests that some of the alarm may be misguided. Essentially, the paper suggests, many of the studies on UPFs and their adverse effects on health are not accounting for the differences in processing and ingredients of certain subgroups. By lumping them all together, these approaches tend to paint all UPFs with the same brush.##True#1#False##20#2024-10-09T08:15:27#932#2024-10-09T10:13:10#84#1#09.10.2024 10:13:10#2024-10-09#2024-10-09
1713#N-2024-712#Uptake of PFAS in crops#The study found significant variation in PFAS uptake by grass-based forage crops grown in biosolid-amended soils. Higher PFOS TFs were associated with elevated levels of precursors like PFOSA and NEtFOSAA. The study suggests that these precursors may contribute to PFOS accumulation in plants. Additionally, a second harvest of forage crops showed higher PFOS uptake compared to the first.#Biosolids : are solid organic matter recovered from a sewage treatment process and used as fertilizer.#True#1#True#01.10.2024 00:00:00#20#2024-10-09T09:05:34#1192#2024-10-09T10:10:35#84#2#09.10.2024 10:10:34#2024-10-09#2024-10-09
