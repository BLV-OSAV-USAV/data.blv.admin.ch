Several studies suggest that<br>QAACs co-select for antibiotic resistant microorganisms and thus may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance<br>in the environment. Data on QAAC occurrence in soil are scarce and limited to soils that are prone to direct exposure to<br>QAACs. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive study on the occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesse, a federal state<br>in Germany, covering an area of 21,115 km2. Sixty-five soil samples that comprised different land uses (arable, grass-<br>land, forest, vineyard) and area types (rural, agglomeration) were analysed for concentrations of<br>alkyltrimethylammonium (ATMACs, with alkyl chain lengths C8-C16), benzylalkyldimethylammonium (BACs, C8-<br>C18) and dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs, C8-C18) via HPLC-MS/MS after ultrasonic-assisted ex-<br>traction with acidified acetonitrile. QAACs were detected in 97 % of the soil samples irrespective of land use and area<br>type. The most abundant QAAC homologues were DADMACs &gt; BACs &gt; ATMACs. The highest total QAAC concentra-<br>tions were detected in alluvial soils influenced by the deposition of suspended particles during flood events, with<br>DADMAC-C16 and -C18 as the dominant homologues. The high abundance of long-chain DADMACs suggests that leg-<br>acy pollution and accumulation govern QAAC concentrations in soils. The presence of QAACs in forest soils points to a<br>potential input via atmospheric deposition. Our work highlights the widespread occurrence of QAACs in soils of Hesse<br>and the need for more research on their entry paths and fate in the soil ecosystem.#Might have - beside other quaternary ammonium compounds - impact into drinking water safety and soil dependent vegetable cultures#True#0#False##20#2023-04-04T06:48:04#971#2023-04-04T11:06:48#932#2#04.04.2023 11:06:48#2023-04-04#2023-04-04

Officials are concerned that added vitamins, minerals, caffeine, or other substances in the beverages may pose a health risk for consumers.   Certain quantities of vitamins, minerals, and other substances can be added to various foods and beverages. If they are not already permitted, the business must apply for approval. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority then assesses whether the added items may pose a health risk before a permit is granted.   The agency said so far it has not received applications from importers with the necessary information about Prime products. Some flavors have a higher caffeine content than is permitted under current regulations. Others have a high amount of vitamin A, which people can get in sufficient quantities from other foods. Excessive intake of vitamin A over a long period can damage the liver.   The Norwegian Food Safety Authority said importers are responsible for the safety of goods they bring into the country and must ensure products meet the relevant regulations.   In Denmark, the sale of such products without notification is not allowed.   The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) said it has found Prime drinks illegally sold online via websites such as Facebook. The agency recently banned sales of the drinks from five registered and unregistered companies. Efforts are part of an ongoing control campaign, where companies’ sales of items that include added vitamins, minerals or certain other substances are being checked.   The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said it had been approached by parents who asked if the drink was safe for their children.   If Prime products have added substances or amounts of additives that are not pre-approved, then they must go through an approval process but authorities said this hasn’t happened. If the drinks comply with the rules for added quantities, importers can register them so they can be legally sold in Denmark.#The product may be found/sold also in Switzerland: <a href="https://www.u-buy.ch/en/brand/prime-hydration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy Prime Hydration Products Online at Best Prices | Ubuy Switzerland (u-buy.ch)</a>#True#1#False##20#2023-05-17T07:36:14#84#2023-05-23T08:13:40#932#1#23.05.2023 08:13:40#2023-05-17#2023-05-23

Cholera is mainly caused by cholera toxin (CT) producing toxigenic O1 and O139 serogroup Vibrio cholerae strains. While most toxigenic V. cholerae cases in Australia are thought to be caused by international-acquired infections, Australia has its own indigenous toxigenic and non-toxigenic O1 and non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae (NOVC) strains. In Australia, in the 1970s and again in 2012, it was reported that south-east Queensland riverways were a reservoir for toxigenic V. cholerae strains that were linked to local cases. Further surveillance on environmental reservoirs, such as riverways, has not been reported in the literature in the last 10 years. Here we present data from sites previously related to outbreaks and surveillance sampling to detect the presence of V. cholerae using PCR in conjunction with MALDI-TOF and whole-genome sequencing. In this study, we were able to detect NOVC at all 10 sites with all sites having toxigenic non-O1, non-O139 strains. Among 133 NOVC isolates, 22 were whole-genome sequenced and compared with previously sequenced Australian O1 and NOVC strains. None of the samples tested grew toxigenic or non-toxigenic O1 or O139, responsible for epidemic disease. Since NOVC can be pathogenic, continuous surveillance is required to assist in theclinical and envir rapid identification of sources of any outbreaks and to assist public health authorities in implementing control measures.##True#2#False##20#2023-10-09T07:47:19#84#2023-10-11T16:40:23#932#1#11.10.2023 16:40:23#2023-10-09#2023-10-11

Nutrients can run off of land in urban areas where lawn and garden fertilizers are used. Nutrients can lead to a massive overgrowth of algae, known as an algae  bloom. Certain types of algae emit toxins that are absorbed by shellfish; consuming these tainted shellfish can lead to stomach illness and shortterm memory problems. Drinking or coming into contact with toxins from algae blooms can cause stomach aches, rashes and more serious <br>problems. Excess nitrogen is a common drinking water contaminant in agricultural areas and can pose particular risk to infants younger than six months old. Chemicals used to treat nutrient-polluted drinking water can pose additional risks to human health. These chemicals, including chlorine, can react with the algae in the water to form disinfection by-products that have been associated with reproductive and developmental health problems.

A total of 66 companies and 16 authorities participated in the survey. The results provide important insights related to what the main food safety priorities are, how they are addressed in the countries that participated in the survey, and what the role of the main stakeholders is in the food value chain. Almost 50% of food companies identified ‘food fraud’ as the most influential food safety attribute. One-third of food safety authorities recognized ‘food safety management system’ as the most influential food safety attribute. Principal component analysis separated food safety statements into two dimensions named ‘food safety hazards and risks’ and ‘food safety system’. Although there are slight differences in food safety statements between the two stakeholders, i.e., food companies and food safety authorities, it is the country of origin that plays a more important role in understanding their views. Food companies will need to implement a systemic approach and transform the entire food value chain continuum while considering new food safety challenges. It is expected that food safety authorities will have to play a more proactive role in the future.##True#1#False##20#2024-03-04T07:20:31#84#2024-03-05T06:57:50#932#1#05.03.2024 06:57:50#2024-03-04#2024-03-05

This review aims to systematically outline the impact of incorporating whole algae and their extracts into various meat products, examining their effects on quality, physicochemical and functional properties, sensory characteristics, and potential for enhancing shelf life. Adding algae to meat products generally <strong>increased pH values</strong>, with variations influenced by concentration, type, initial pH, and storage time.

While including algae improved water-holding capacity and decreased cooking loss, it often led to increased hardness and chewiness. Algae and their extracts influenced color attributes, with variations based on the algae type. Sensory properties were distinctively affected, generally reducing overall acceptability, although Sea tangle at concentrations of 1–3% showed acceptable scores. Chlorella and Sea tangle positively impacted microbiology during refrigerated storage, while algae and their extracts demonstrated strong antioxidant activity.#The introduction of new ingredients, such as algae, can change the physico-chemical properties of the food, making it more favourable for pathogens to grow due to a higher pH or lower salt content.#True#1#False##20#2024-03-08T07:27:52#84#2024-03-11T10:21:25#932#1#11.03.2024 10:21:25#2024-03-08#2024-03-11

1219#N-2024-218#Decline in the nutritional quality of foods#In the last sixty years, there has been an alarming decline in food quality and a decrease in a wide variety of nutritionally essential minerals and nutraceutical compounds in imperative fruits, vegetables, and food crops. The potential causes behind the decline in the nutritional quality of foods have been identified worldwide as chaotic mineral nutrient application, the preference for less nutritious cultivars/crops, the use of high-yielding varieties, and agronomic issues associated with a shift from natural farming to chemical farming. Likewise, the rise in atmospheric or synthetically elevated carbon dioxide could contribute to the extensive reductions in the nutritional quality of fruits, vegetables, and food crops. Since ancient times, nutrient-intense crops such as millets, conventional fruits, and vegetables have been broadly grown and are the most important staple food, but the area dedicated to these crops has been declining steadily over the past few decades and hastily after the green revolution era due to their poorer economic competitiveness with major commodities such as high-yielding varieties of potato, tomato, maize, wheat, and rice. The majority of the population in underdeveloped and developing countries have lower immune systems, are severely malnourished, and have multiple nutrient deficiency disorders due to poor dietary intake and less nutritious foods because of ignorance about the importance of our traditional nutrient-rich diets and ecofriendly organic farming methods. This critical review emphasizes the importance of balance and adequate nutrition as well as the need to improve soil biodiversity and fertility: those are main causes behind the decline in nutritional density. There is also emphasis on a possible way out of alleviating the decline nutritional density of food crops for the health and well-being of future generations.##True#2#False##20#2024-03-15T07:05:33#84#2024-03-15T10:26:11#932#1#15.03.2024 10:26:11#2024-03-15#2024-03-15

1237#N-2024-236#Usutu virus#Usutu virus (USUV) has a history dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, with its first isolation and detection in Europe. Since 2009, there has been increased identification and monitoring of USUV in animals (avifauna and equine). Recently, there have been many more detections, partially reflecting increased attention in surveillance. There is concern about the zoonotic potential of USUV and whether increased detection in wild animals will soon be reflected in an increase of cases in humans. A recent survey in blood donors conducted in France indicated presence of that virus in human as a blood sample was identified positive among 8000 tested.

1238#N-2024-237#Aichivirus (AiV)#There is a growing interest in understanding Aichivirus (AiV), particularly its mode  of transmission and clinical implications. The primary mode of transmission for AiV  is through the faecal-oral route, where the virus replicates in the cells of the  gastrointestinal (GI) tract. AiV infections often manifest with subclinical symptoms,  evidenced by a high prevalence of seroconversion but a low incidence of clinically  apparent disease. Symptoms associated with AiV infection are non-specific and  may include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Some cases  can be severe, leading to hospitalisation and extraintestinal complications such as  lower respiratory tract infections.  The importance of AiV as a cause of acute gastroenteritis varies across different  studies and settings. Testing of faecal samples has revealed a relatively low  incidence of AiV among cases of acute gastroenteritis, ranging from 0.9% to 4.1%  in various studies. Additionally, co-infection with other viruses is not uncommon,  occurring in 50-80% of cases in different studies. However, the significance of AiV  as a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis is highlighted in certain contexts. AiV  infections are widespread globally, with a high proportion of adults showing  seropositivity indicating exposure. Seropositivity rates typically increase with age,  with over 80% of individuals seropositive by age 40 in many regions. Infections  may occur in waves, with childhood and adolescence being common periods of  exposure. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) methods are commonly used to detect the <br>presence of the virus in stool samples and vomitus, aiding in diagnosis and  surveillance efforts. However, information regarding the infective dose of AiV <br>remains unknown.  AiV, is associated with foodborne illnesses, with shellfish being a confirmed vehicle,  although under-reporting is likely. Transmission via other foods and person-toperson contact is possible. AiV has been detected in raw and treated sewage as  well as surface and groundwater sources, suggesting potential waterborne  transmission pathways. However, the significance of food in AiV transmission  remains uncertain, highlighting the need for further research in this area.##True#1#False##20#2024-03-22T14:49:10#84#2024-04-08T11:39:16#932#1#08.04.2024 11:39:16#2024-03-22#2024-04-08

To determine if this STEC O157:H7 has greater potential for survival in kimchi than other STEC, the outbreak strain and six other STEC strains (O26:H11, O91:H21, O103:H2, O121:H19, and two O157:H7) were inoculated individually at 6 to 6.5 log CFU/g into commercially sourced kimchi and incubation at 4 °C. At intervals of seven days inoculated and control kimchi was plated onto MacConkey agar to enumerate lactose utilising bacteria. The colony counts were interpreted as enumerating the inoculated STEC, since no colonies were observed on MacConkey agar plated with uninoculated kimchi. Over eight weeks of incubation the pH was stable at 4.10 to 4.05 and the STEC strains declined by 0.7–1.0 log, with a median reduction of 0.9 log. The linear rate of reduction of kimchi outbreak STEC O157:H7 was −0.4 log per 30 days (Slope Uncertainty 0.05), which was not significantly different from the other O157 and nonO 157 STEC strains (P = 0.091).

It is known that the capacities to produce cereulide vary greatly between different strains but the genetic background of these variations is not clear.In this study, cereulide production capacities were associated with genetic characteristics. For this, cereulide levels in cultures of 31 strains were determined after incubation in tryptic soy broth for 24 h at 24 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C. Whole genome sequencing based data were used for an in-depth characterization of gene sequences related to cereulide production. The taxonomy, population structure and phylogenetic relationships of the strains were evaluated based on average nucleotide identity, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), core genome MLST and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses. Despite a limited strain number, the approach of a genome wide association study (GWAS) was tested to link genetic variation with cereulide quantities.Our study confirms strain-dependent differences in cereulide production. For most strains, these differences were not explainable by sequence variations in the <em>cesHPTABCD</em> gene cluster or the regulatory genes <em>abrB</em>, <em>spo0A</em>, <em>codY</em> and <em>pagRBc</em>.

After a 35-day feeding period, the larvae consumed both pristine and aged MPs. Although aged MPs inhibited larvae growth due to limited nutrient supply, they were depolymerized more efficiently in gut microbiota than pristine MPs. The metabolic intermediates of aged MPs contained more oxygen-containing functional groups and shortened long-chain alkane. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the richness and diversity of gut microbes were restricted in the MPs-fed group.

However, flunking in food safety is not an option, especially when children are most vulnerable to foodborne illness. Keep Cold Foods Cold and Hot Foods Hot : 
<ul>
<li><strong>Cold Foods</strong>: Always use at least two cold sources like frozen gel packs, frozen juice boxes, or frozen water bottles to keep foods cold. Foods that sit out at room temperature are at risk of entering the “Danger Zone” (temperatures between <strong>5°C and 60°C </strong>where bacteria can multiply quickly and cause illness).</li>
<li><strong>Hot Foods</strong>: When packing hot foods like chili, soups, or stews, make sure to use an insulated container to keep the food hot. Keep the container closed until lunchtime to keep the food at <strong>60°C or above</strong>.</li>

1381#N-2024-380#Microbiological safety of dry-aged meat#Dry-aged meat is gaining popularity among food business operators and private consumers. The process is carried out in aerobic conditions by hanging beef carcasses or placing subprimal or primal cuts in a dedicated cabinet for several weeks or even months while controlling the environment through the management of process parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and airflow. In this review, we present a critical evaluation of the literature to evaluate tools to manage the process to guarantee food safety and identify critical control points, as well as good hygienic and manufacturing practices. In controlled aging conditions, only <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> and <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> can multiply, while a reduction in the number of <em>Salmonella</em> spp. and <em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7 is generally reported. <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> usually decrease on the surface of the meat during maturation; thus, for the purpose of the hygienic evaluation of the production process, a count no higher than that of unmatured meat is expected. Besides, various studies report that the total bacterial count and the spoilage microorganisms significantly increase on the surface of the meat, up to 5-6 Log CFU/g in the absence of visible spoilage. Bacteria of the <em>Pseudomonas</em> genus tend to progressively replace other microorganisms during maturation; thus, the total mesophilic or psychrophilic bacterial load is not a good indicator of process hygiene for matured meat. Critical parameters for the control of the process are temperature, relative humidity, and ventilation, which should be monitored during the process. For this reason, equipment designed and certified for dry aging must be used, and the manufacturer must validate the process. Food business operators must apply general good manufacturing practices (GMP) and good hygiene practices (GHP) for meat processing and some GMP and GHP specific for dry aging. Several research needs were identified, among them the evolution of the populations of <em>L. monocytogenes</em> and <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> and the microbiology of the inner parts of the dry-aged meat.##True#1#False##20#2024-05-21T06:43:57#84#2024-05-22T14:40:56#932#1#22.05.2024 14:40:56#2024-05-21#2024-05-22

1587#N-2024-586#Human Aichivirus (AiV)#Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods. AiV belongs to the genus Kobuvirus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions. Furthermore, several studies conducted in Japan, Germany, France, Tunisia and Spain showed a high prevalence of AiV antibodies in adults (between 80% and 99%), which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus. The aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human Aichi virus (AiV), discussing the possibles routes of transmission, new detection techniques and future research. Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections. Further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of AiV in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide.##True#1#False##20#2024-08-23T10:18:14#84#2024-09-16T07:24:21#932#2#16.09.2024 07:24:21#2024-08-23#2024-09-16

BA has caused numerous foodborne illness outbreaks with high mortality rates, primarily in fermented foods like corn flour and rice noodles, due to specific environmental conditions. The review highlights the toxin's mechanism of action, detection methods, and the importance of prevention through proper food handling, as there is no known antidote, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic capabilities to address this growing threat. Bongkrekic acid (BA) represents an emerging food safety threat with significant public health implications. This review examines the current understanding of BA, a potent mitochondrial toxin produced by <em>Burkholderia gladioli </em>pathovar <em>cocovenenans </em>, which has caused numerous foodborne illness outbreaks with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 100%. The toxin, first identified in 1895 from Indonesian fermented coconut products (tempe bongkrek), has been implicated in over 300 cases globally, with recent outbreaks reported in China, Indonesia, Mozambique, and Taiwan. BA production occurs in fermented foods under specific conditions, including neutral pH, temperatures of 22-30°C, and high fatty acid content, particularly oleic acid. Common implicated foods include fermented corn flour, rice noodles, rehydrated mushrooms, and coconut products. As little as 1-1.5 mg can be fatal, causing gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms progressing to multi-organ failure.##True#1#False##20#2025-10-21T10:08:51#401#2025-10-22T07:02:24#84#4#22.10.2025 07:02:24#2025-10-21#2025-10-22

Here we investigate the effect of the bioprotective strain <em>Carnobacterium divergens </em>V41 on the health of on-growing Atlantic salmon ( <em>Salmo salar </em>) and spoilage of its fillets throughout storage. The strain was administered throughout a three-month growth period and applied to the water in the fish tanks prior to harvest to assess its impact on animal health, shelf-life properties of the processed fillets, and growth inhibition of <em>Listeria </em>. Administering the strain through feed for three months had no adverse effect on the farmed fish, and no significant differences were detected in growth or mortality between the treatment and control groups. However, adding <em>C. divergens </em>V41 to the tank water prior to harvesting markedly changed the fillet microbiome, suppressing the growth of spoilage organisms and thereby possibly extending the shelf-life period.
