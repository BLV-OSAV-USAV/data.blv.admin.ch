36,2,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42,"[1533, 1338]"
191,1,F-2022-347,Cheapflation in the food industry,"As inflation rises and consumer purchasing power falls, food manufacturers and retailers are trying to adapt to avoid eroding their margins.Cheapflation (or the lowering of food quality) consists of replacing certain products or foods with cheaper substitutes (food or not). The aim is obviously to maintain margins or sell more products. Examples abound on the internet and the Reddit site in particular echoes them. The most obvious example of cheapflation is that of certain ice creams now called 'frozen desserts', because the dairy products that made them up have been replaced by fillers.",False,2022-05-11T00:00:00,2025-02-26T09:11:57,1.0,4,[2020]
238,1,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-04-02T07:52:27,2.0,60,[1472]
125,1,F-2021-257,Melatonin for post-harvest treatment,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is known as a potential free radical. In a study by Li et al. (2021), the prolonged effect of the shelf life of white champignons was investigated. These had a significantly longer shelf life depending on the treatment. Melatonin also delays the leaf senescence of Chinese cabbage (Tan et al. 2020) or the yellowing of broccoli (Wu et al. 2021 or Miao et al. 2020). It is also employed in the ripening of fruit (such as tomatoes; Sun et al. 2020) or to increase the resistance of grapes (Gao et al. 2020). Melatonin is found in plant-based foods and in very small doses also in animal foods. The highest melatonin content is found in cranberries (up to 9,600 µg/100g dry weight). Other sources of melatonin are some types of mushrooms (saffron milk cap, common boletus, agaricus bisporus, chanterelle), some types of cereals (corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley), mustard seeds, dried tomatoes and peppers, and some types of wine (wikipedia).",True,2021-02-25T00:00:00,2025-03-04T07:17:30,1.0,21,[1993]
