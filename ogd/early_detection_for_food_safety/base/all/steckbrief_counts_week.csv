116,2,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:04:42,1.5,27.0,"[2344, 2345]"
95,2,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,85.0,"[2347, 2354]"
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2025-08-07T08:20:17,2.0,12.0,[2344]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-08-06T07:01:11,1.0,57.0,[2348]
143,1,F-2021-291,Circular economy,"The Circular Economy (CE) is an approach that decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, avoids waste, opposes the linear economic model of 'take-produce-consume-waste' and replaces it with an economic model based on sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling in an (almost) closed loop. Such a shift from a linear economy to a circular economy is expected to significantly support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). However, the design and implementation of the circular economy requires careful consideration of the numerous trade-offs that may arise. This is a prerequisite for achieving SDG 3 (Good health and well-being).In the transition to a circular economy, it will be crucial to identify potentially emerging risks to the environment and food and feed safety in a holistic and integrated manner in order to achieve an optimal balance between opportunities, benefits and risks. It is important to ensure that food and feed safety and environmental health considerations are included at an early stage of research or policy initiatives related to recycling and the circular economy.",False,2021-12-18T00:00:00,2024-10-14T08:57:22,1.0,7.0,[2349]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-07-10T06:38:46,1.0,56.0,[2350]
125,1,F-2021-257,Melatonin for pre- and post-harvest treatment,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is known as a potential free radical. In a study by Li et al. (2021), the prolonged effect of the shelf life of white champignons was investigated. These had a significantly longer shelf life depending on the treatment. Melatonin also delays the leaf senescence of Chinese cabbage (Tan et al. 2020) or the yellowing of broccoli (Wu et al. 2021 or Miao et al. 2020). It is also employed in the ripening of fruit (such as tomatoes; Sun et al. 2020) or to increase the resistance of grapes (Gao et al. 2020). Melatonin is found in plant-based foods and in very small doses also in animal foods. The highest melatonin content is found in cranberries (up to 9,600 µg/100g dry weight). Other sources of melatonin are some types of mushrooms (saffron milk cap, common boletus, agaricus bisporus, chanterelle), some types of cereals (corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley), mustard seeds, dried tomatoes and peppers, and some types of wine (wikipedia).",True,2021-02-25T00:00:00,2025-08-07T07:57:23,1.0,25.0,[2342]
