102,1,F-2021-148,Antibiotics to treat citrus greening disease,"Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is a bacterial disease affecting citrus fruit and is spread through an invasive insect, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Once a tree is infected, there is no effective way of controlling or curing it. The disease poses no threat to humans or animals but can infest all types of citrus trees making it a serious threat to the global citrus fruit industry. Antibiotics are being used in some countries to handle the problem. In the USA, there is a discussion about allowing farmers to use two antibiotics (streptomycin and oxytetracycline)  several times a year as a routine treatment. There is little scientific evidence on the long-term use of these drugs in crop environments. Further, the use of antibiotics on a small-scale has previously shown to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows farmers to harvest a few more crops from infected trees, however, the spread cannot be prevented. The potential use of antibiotics on a larger scale increases concerns about the developing resistance to antibiotics.",True,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2025-02-11T08:34:35,1.0,34.0,[2081]
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2024-08-13T06:38:22,1.0,7.0,[2084]
121,1,F-2021-239,Campylobacter lanienae at the slaughterhouse,"Foodborne campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial enteritis in Germany. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.",False,2021-01-31T00:00:00,2024-02-14T08:25:03,2.0,7.0,[2089]
263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,2.0,4.0,[2089]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52.0,[2086]
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-02-24T07:25:43,1.0,38.0,[2080]
