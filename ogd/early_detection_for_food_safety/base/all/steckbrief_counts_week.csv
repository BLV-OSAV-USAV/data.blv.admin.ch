190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2025-08-07T08:20:17,2.0,12.0,[2536]
178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-07-28T07:15:51,2.0,30.0,[2538]
95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,86.0,[2540]
