8,2,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-08-19T08:04:46,1.0,58,"[2456, 2462]"
21,1,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-07-12T14:11:49,1.0,10,[2456]
7,1,F-2018-023,Microbiological safety: convenience products (produce),"Convenience (ready-to-eat) products are very popular. These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production? Is it a question of cross-contamination in production, in households?",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-11-28T07:59:19,1.0,37,[2460]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-09-08T13:38:04,1.0,45,[2464]
