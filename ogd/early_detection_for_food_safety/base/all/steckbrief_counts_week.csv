8,2,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52,"[2069, 2058]"
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,1.0,50,[2066]
273,1,F-2024-021,Microdosing candies,"The Food and Drug Administration is investigating nearly 50 illnesses—including one possible death—that might be linked to microdosing candies available online and at retailers nationwide. These chocolate bars and gummies showed higher than normal amounts of muscimol, a chemical found in mushrooms of the genus amanita, wich could be a potential cause of symptoms consistent with those observed in persons who became ill after eating the products",True,2024-07-04T08:58:03,2025-01-09T08:32:27,1.0,20,[2070]
