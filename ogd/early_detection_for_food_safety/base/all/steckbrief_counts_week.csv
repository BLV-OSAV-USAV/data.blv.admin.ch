95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2024-09-23T07:55:14,1.0,65.0,[1712]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-08-30T08:15:03,1.0,28.0,[1713]
196,1,F-2022-352,PFOS in meat,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (conjugate base perfluorooctanesulfonate) is an anthropogenic (man-made) fluorosurfactant, now regarded as a global pollutant. There is a major focus on PFOS hotspot contaminations in DK right now. During the spring and summer a site previously used for training fires and firefighting has been investigated. A field close to the site was used for grassing by cows owned by 20 families. Five cows each summer has been grassing there. PFOS is analysed in the meat at concentrations from 156 to 230 ng/g in four samples from four cows. Also grass was analyzed from the area up to 165 ng/g and water in the stream showed very high levels. The theory is that rainwater is running off in the direction of the field and the stream. So the cows have had the intake both from the water in the stream and from the grass. About 187 local consumers, that have eaten the meat through the years, have had the blood analyzed for PFOS. There are a big variation of PFOS in the blood. From 1,1 ng/ml up to 500 ng/ml. Doctors at the nearby hospital will follow the people who has high levels in the blood and try to help them. They will now try to use a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that is thought to increase the secretion of PFOS. 145 other areas around DK, where use of PFOS has been going on, will now be investigated.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-09-04T06:40:26,1.0,6.0,[1713]
24,1,F-2019-044,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE, syn. FSME)","TBE or tick-borne encephalitis (encephalitis = inflammation of the brain) is an infectious disease caused by the TBE virus. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick (Castor bean tick). This is the most significant way of transmitting the virus. An alimentary transmission by unpasteurised milk, or milk products from acutely infected goats or cattle was reported on and has been discussed repeatedly in the past. In Germany, two outbreaks, caused by alimentary transmissions, were detected in 2016 and 2017 respectively. TBE is a viral infection caused by one in three tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis).",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-10-09T09:56:29,1.0,37.0,[1711]
