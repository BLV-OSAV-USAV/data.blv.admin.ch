168,1,F-2021-319,Enterocytozoon bieneusi - Microsporidia,"In 2020, Denmark reported a large outbreak caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi, an obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasite belonging to the order Microsporidia (Li W et al., 2020). An unprecedented outbreak in a canteen caused by this pathogen affected 77 employees of a Danish company. E. bieneusi is a microorganism that is rarely found in Denmark and has not caused any outbreaks to date. The source of the outbreak was a lunch box in the company canteen, but a specific food item could not be identified.E. bieneusi is associated with food-, water- and hospital-associated outbreaks. Its identification requires molecular methods such as qPCR, which are not routinely used in most EU Member States.",False,2021-10-26T00:00:00,2022-09-12T10:28:05,2.0,2.0,[2582]
183,1,F-2022-339,Coxiella burnetii increase in animal population,"Q fever is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The natural reservoir of the pathogen is cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, some wild animals and ticks. Infected animals often show no symptoms, but excrete the pathogen mainly via birth products of farm animals (e.g. placenta), which are usually highly infectious, but also via faeces, urine or milk. In the majority of cases, infection in humans occurs through inhalation of dust containing the pathogen, but also through direct contact with infected animals. People who are in close contact with animals (animal owners, veterinarians, slaughterhouse employees, etc.) are particularly affected. Depending on the wind conditions, however, people in the immediate vicinity of infected animals can also become infected. In about half of the people infected, the infection causes no symptoms or only mild flu-like symptoms that disappear spontaneously. The other half experience sudden fever, chills, sweating, fatigue and headache, which can be complicated by inflammation of the lungs, liver, heart muscle or brain. Q fever is usually treated with antibiotics to prevent the disease from becoming chronic. Besides sporadic cases, outbreaks can also occur.There is a steady increase of reported cases in the animal population since 2014 in Switzerland; cattle: 2014: 54; 2021: 131; Goat: 2014:3; 2021: 19; sheep 1; 2021:10). In 2020, a total of 51 human cases of Q fever were reported to the FOPH, which corresponds to a reporting rate of 0.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the previous year, there were almost twice as many cases due to an outbreak, with 101 cases. The outbreak was most likely linked to two infected goat herds in Ticino. There is no similalr increase in the human population as observed in the animal population.",False,2022-03-31T00:00:00,2022-09-01T14:48:36,2.0,5.0,[2582]
95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,86.0,[2575]
11,1,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.",True,2018-12-20T00:00:00,2025-12-15T08:10:54,1.0,53.0,[2581]
147,1,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,2.0,10.0,[2576]
187,1,F-2022-343,Herbs and spices - fraudulent manipulations,"Culinary herbs and spices are valued for flavouring food and could also provide other beneficial properties, such as antioxidative and bacteriostatic effects as well as certain pharmacological activities. Their supply chain is complex, long, and globalised. Europe is one of the world’s leading importing regions for herbs and spices, importing approximately 300.000 tons, mostly spices from East Asia. Most of the spices are produced in countries where certain post-harvest processes such as drying and cleaning may happen before being shipped to the importing country where they are further cleaned and sanitised before being packaged and distributed either to other food businesses or for retail consumption. At each stage, fraudulent manipulations may happen and the more often the material is transferred from one operator to the next, the fraud opportunity increases",False,2022-05-02T00:00:00,2022-09-12T13:16:19,1.0,4.0,[2585]
33,1,F-2018-053,EHEC: continuous increase in lab reports,"In 2017, a total of 696 VTEC cases confirmed by laboratory diagnostics were reported to the FOPH (463 in the previous year). This is once again an increase of 50% compared to the previous year. The rate resulting from 8.2 new cases reported per 100,000 inhabitants is the highest rate since the obligation to report was introduced in 1999. As in the previous year, most cases were registered in the third quarter. The age group of children under 5 years continued to show the highest rate of 16.0 per 100,000 inhabitants reported and accounted for 10% of reported VTEC cases. (source: Zoonosis Report 2018). This increase was already discussed in 2015, and at that time, this was attributed to the spread of new diagnostic methods (FOPH, 2015). New investigations by Swiss TPH show that the increase in case numbers are partially due to new analytics, but not exclusively. A seperate investigation is underway and about to be completed. It concludes that there is a real increase.",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-05-31T07:40:14,1.0,23.0,[2584]
