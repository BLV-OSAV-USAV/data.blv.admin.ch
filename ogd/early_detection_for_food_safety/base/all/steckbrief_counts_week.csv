34,2,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-07-10T06:38:46,1.0,56,"[2363, 2366]"
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-07-23T07:01:10,1.0,41,[2364]
25,1,F-2019-045,Insects for human consumption,The microbiological safety of insects approved for consumption is the subject of various studies. These products are relatively new on the market and corresponding experience is lacking.,False,2019-01-31T00:00:00,2025-07-07T06:37:16,1.0,27,[2367]
293,1,F-2025-010,Zoonotic potential of foodborne isolates of Klebsiella spp.,"Human infections with Klebsiella have so far been primarily associated with nosocomial infections. Numerous studies now show that Klebsiella spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,1.0,6,[2369]
21,1,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-07-12T14:11:49,2.0,10,[2358]
11,1,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.",True,2018-12-20T00:00:00,2025-08-18T07:36:47,1.0,50,[2365]
