211,2,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2022.2089625?needAccess=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Banach et al. (2022) </a>provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,43,"[2639, 2648]"
122,1,F-2021-240,Feed additive: 3-NOP in foods?,"Methane — a natural byproduct of digestion in ruminants — is released by cows into the atmosphere mostly through belching . The addition of 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) to the feed of dairy cows reduced their enteric methane emissions by about 25%.The compound inhibits an enzyme that is crucial to the final stage of methane synthesis in a cow’s rumen. When 3-NOP is fed to cattle, their methane production is inhibited.",False,2021-02-03T00:00:00,2022-09-16T11:04:54,1.0,5,[2646]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. <a href=""https://www.tagblatt.ch/wirtschaft/das-ist-die-protein-pflanze-der-zukunft-thurgauer-unternehmer-ueber-den-wunderbaum-mit-potenzial-ld.1215367"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Interview in the Tagblatt</a>.

A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from <strong>poultry to humans</strong>, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,8,[2640]
