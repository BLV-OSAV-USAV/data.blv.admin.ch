233,1,F-2023-016,Social media and food safety risk,"Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.",True,2023-03-13T13:01:19,2025-02-12T07:11:17,1.0,50.0,[2192]
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-02-24T07:25:43,2.0,39.0,[2190]
21,1,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-07-12T14:11:49,1.0,10.0,[2193]
35,1,F-2019-055,Nanoparticles in foods,"Nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the food industry to modulate various aspects of food. As a result, man-made nanoparticles are increasingly being used as functional ingredients in foods and beverages. They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed. One study shows how nanoparticles can positively influence bacteria of the digestive tract. They speak of ""probiotic nanoparticles"". Nanoparticles are also already being used in pharmacy, for example to precisely transport substances to where they are needed.",True,2019-10-18T00:00:00,2025-05-27T07:41:31,1.0,21.0,[2189]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53.0,[2194]
