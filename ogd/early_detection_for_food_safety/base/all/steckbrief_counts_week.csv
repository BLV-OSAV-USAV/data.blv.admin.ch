8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-10-10T08:53:59,1.0,59,[2476]
42,1,F-2019-062,Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis,"In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.",True,2019-07-11T00:00:00,2025-10-09T07:44:35,1.0,52,[2472]
160,1,F-2021-309,Human milk donation and associated health risks,"In the absence of a lactarium in French-speaking Switzerland, young mothers give, sell, buy, or receive breast milk. There are platforms for these exchanges on social networks, but they do not seem to be supervised by health professionals. The journalist in this article raises the microbiological and toxicological risks that the failure to respect certain basic sanitary rules (use of medication and bacterial contamination by Salmonella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus) may represent for breast milk and therefore for the newborn. In 2022, a first lactarium will be opened, it is possible that these platforms will or will not cease to exist, but the question concerning the professional supervision of this issue remains if they continue to exist.",False,2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-01-13T15:13:17,1.0,8,[2468]
13,1,F-2018-029,Cyclospora,"Cyclospora infection is an intestinal disease caused by a unicellular parasite. Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected. The list of outbreaks is long and seems to have been increasing in recent years.",True,2018-12-17T00:00:00,2025-02-28T07:42:44,1.0,20,[2465]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-09-24T06:44:21,1.0,60,[2474]
222,1,F-2023-005,Protein supplements : effects of a (too) high protein diet,"""A high protein intake is great for losing weight, but it's also great for athletes."" With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more ""high protein"" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this ""high protein"" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the ""healthy"" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of ""if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt"".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite ""high protein"" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly.  In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.",True,2023-01-27T13:00:59,2025-09-16T07:10:35,1.0,24,[2478]
