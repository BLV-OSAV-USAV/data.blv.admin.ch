257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another study found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2024-09-30T09:20:31,1.0,24,[1853]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-11-26T14:04:08,1.0,29,[1854]
188,1,F-2022-344,Trifluoroacetate (TFA) in water,"Trifluoroacetate (TFA) is a mobile and persistent substance that is primarily introduced into the water cycle through the degradation of various fluorochemicals and remains there for an unforeseeable period of time. There is already a high baseline load of TFA in many water bodies with some regional hotspots. This background paper presents current data and estimates on sources, input pathways, loads, impacts and measures on TFA. It gives an outlook on first activities and options to comprehensively minimise TFA inputs to the environment. Despite gaps in knowledge, it becomes clear that consistent regulation and an overarching minimisation strategy must be initiated in the short term.",False,2022-05-03T00:00:00,2022-09-19T10:52:44,1.0,4,[1854]
