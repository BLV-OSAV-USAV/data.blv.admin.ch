86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2026-01-14T16:31:44,1.0,67,[2659]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2026-01-19T07:21:22,1.0,50,[2670]
267,1,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of <strong>avian flu</strong> in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a <strong>case fatality</strong> rate of <strong>52%</strong>. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in <strong>cow's milk</strong> in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the <strong>consumption of pasteurized milk</strong> and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2026-02-02T06:31:04,1.0,82,[2668]
