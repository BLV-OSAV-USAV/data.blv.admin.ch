95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2024-11-06T09:08:12,1.0,69.0,[1791]
178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",False,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2024-11-05T11:09:59,2.0,13.0,[1789]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-11-04T08:12:25,2.0,41.0,[1789]
263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,4.0,[1794]
115,1,F-2021-231,Salmonella Napoli - seasonality,"Individual cases salmonellosis, spread throughout Switzerland and attributable to a specific salmonella species, were frequent in 2019. However, the occurrence of S. Napoli is particularly striking. The cases that have been occurring since 2002 show a seasonal pattern. The weekly threshold defined by the FOPH was exceeded in 2019, triggering investigations which, however, did not reveal any indication of a possible cause of the illness mentioned above. At present, there are no indications of sources or causes of infection. According to literature studies, the pathogen occurs conspicuously often on rocket. However, further investigations also show an association with surface water. Water could thus be a central source, whether as irrigation water for salads and vegetables or as water associated with leisure activities (bathing, swimming, paddling, etc.). Animal products, on the other hand, seem to be of secondary importance. In contrast to other Salmonella serovars, this pathogen seems to cause more invasive diseases in addition to gastrointestinal diseases.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2024-02-26T11:08:34,1.0,34.0,[1794]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-11-08T08:10:41,1.0,51.0,[1793]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:35:42,1.0,47.0,[1787]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity.

83,1,F-2021-123,PFAS in food packaging,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2024-10-08T08:29:00,1.0,48.0,[1795]
199,1,F-2022-355,STEC contamination in pork production chain,"Epidemiological evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections associated with the consumption of contaminated pork highlight the need for increased awareness of STEC as an emerging pathogen in the pork supply chain. The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets. In retail pork, serogroup O26 was prevalent in the U.S., Europe, and Africa. Serogroup O121 was only reported in the U.S. Furthermore, serogroup O91 was reported in the U.S., Asia, and South American retail pork samples. The most common virulence gene combination in retail pork around the globe were as follows: the U.S.: serogroup O157 + stx, non-O157 + stx, unknown serogroups+stx + eae; Europe: unknown serogroups +(stx+ eae, stx2 + eae, or stx1 + stx2 + eae); Asia: O157 + stx1 + stx2 + ehxA, Unknown+stx1 + eaeA + ehxA, or only eae; Africa: O157 + stx2 + eae + ehxA. STEC strains derived from retail pork in the U.S. fall under low to moderate risk categories capable of causing human disease, thus indicating the need for adequate cooking and prevention of cross contamination to minimize infection risk in humans.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-07-01T10:36:13,1.0,7.0,[1785]

126,1,F-2021-273,"6PPD-Chinon - car tire abrasion, artificial turf","Exposure of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to stormwater causes unexplained acute annual mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban streams to reproduce. Investigating this phenomenon, researchers identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a ubiquitous antioxidant found in tyre rubber worldwide. Retrospective analyses of representative U.S. West Coast road runoff and stormwater-influenced streams revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD quinone (<0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unexpected risks of 6PPD antioxidants to this aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for residues derived from tyre rubber.",True,2021-03-01T00:00:00,2024-11-08T08:09:21,2.0,38.0,[1796]
