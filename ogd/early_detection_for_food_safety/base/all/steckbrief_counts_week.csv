95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see <a href=""https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nova"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NOVA Klassifikation</a> for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,87,[2689]
60,1,F-2019-099,Pet food as a vector for pathogen transmission into domestic environments,"Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) <em>Salmonella </em>serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with <em>Salmonella </em>are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).",True,2019-08-05T00:00:00,2026-02-12T07:48:47,2.0,21,[2693]
86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2026-01-14T16:31:44,1.0,69,[2695]
165,1,F-2022-316,Marine toxins: an emerging risk in Europe?,"Ciguatera is the most common form of marine biotoxin food poisoning in the world, with between 10,000 and 50,000 cases reported each year, a figure that is probably far from the reality. Ciguatera poisoning (CTXs) is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Pacific and Caribbean (West Indies). Ciguatera is a complex syndrome with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular effects. The symptoms appear two to twelve hours after the contaminating meal. The question of a possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain.",False,2022-07-21T00:00:00,2025-02-17T07:18:01,1.0,9,[2699]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2026-02-06T06:31:48,1.0,67,[2698]
