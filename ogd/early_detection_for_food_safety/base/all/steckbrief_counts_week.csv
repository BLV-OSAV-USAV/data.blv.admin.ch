51,2,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. <a href=""https://www.tagblatt.ch/wirtschaft/das-ist-die-protein-pflanze-der-zukunft-thurgauer-unternehmer-ueber-den-wunderbaum-mit-potenzial-ld.1215367"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Interview in the Tagblatt</a>.

190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2026-02-02T07:51:14,2.0,13,[2706]
165,1,F-2022-316,Marine toxins: an emerging risk in Europe?,"Ciguatera is the most common form of marine biotoxin food poisoning in the world, with between 10,000 and 50,000 cases reported each year, a figure that is probably far from the reality. Ciguatera poisoning (CTXs) is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Pacific and Caribbean (West Indies). Ciguatera is a complex syndrome with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular effects. The symptoms appear two to twelve hours after the contaminating meal. The question of a possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain.",False,2022-07-21T00:00:00,2026-02-18T06:37:26,1.0,11,[2699]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2026-02-06T06:31:48,1.0,67,[2698]
227,1,F-2023-010,Irrigation with wastewater,"As climatic changes are increasing the pressure on water resources and more fresh fruits and vegetables are needed to meet the demands of a growing population, growers may need to start depending on more varied sources of water for irrigation, including environmental, recycled, and reclaimed wastewaters. Additionally, the wastewater draining from massive pools of sewage sludge has the potential to play a role in more sustainable agriculture (Science of The Total Environment, 20.01.2023). However, this practice is not without risks as some of some of these wastewater sources might be susceptible to contamination with microbial pathogensFor instance, surveys have found <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> in water, soil, vegetation, and farm animal feces around the world. The frequency at which this pathogen is present in water sources is dependent on multiple factors, including the season, surrounding land use, presence of animals, and physicochemical water parameters. Understanding the survival duration of <em>L. monocytogenes </em>in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors. Understanding the pathogen’s ability to remain infectious is key to understanding how <em>L. monocytogenes</em> impacts produce outbreaks and, ultimately, consumers’ health.Moreover, the German federal institute for risk assessment (BfR) has published a risk assessment of transmission of <em>Cryptosporidium </em>spp., <em>Giardia duodenalis</em> and <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>to humans related to using reclaimed wastewater in agriculture where they recommend to only use irrigation water of a quality comparable to drinking water for watering plants that are usually consumed raw.",True,2023-02-28T11:35:21,2025-07-24T07:08:52,1.0,32,[2704]
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2022.2089625?needAccess=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Banach et al. (2022) </a>provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,2.0,43,[2711]
