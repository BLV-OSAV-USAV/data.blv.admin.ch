234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-08-30T08:15:03,1.0,28,[1762]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-09-30T08:28:10,1.0,48,[1759]
282,1,F-2024-030,Foodborne illnesses caused by Edwardsiella tarda,"Edwardsiella (E.) tarda is a bacterial pathogen with a wide host range in fish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. As a fish pathogen, E. tarda has a high economic impact. Foodborne diseases caused by the consumption of contaminated fish and seafood have been described in the past, particularly in Asian countries. There are first indications that the number of human cases of E. tarda infection is increasing and that cases are also occurring outside Asia. Climate change, environmental pollution and an increase in aquaculture are being discussed as possible triggers for the increase and spread. This BeoWarn report summarises current knowledge about the pathogen E. tarda as a possible cause of foodborne diseases.",False,2024-10-28T07:07:57,2024-10-28T11:40:20,1.0,6,[1763]
