238,2,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-04-02T07:52:27,1.0,61.0,"[2171, 2177]"
95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-03-31T07:34:09,1.0,76.0,[2172]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,2.0,51.0,[2176]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53.0,[2175]

This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,2.0,5.0,[2173]

Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy.

31,1,F-2019-051,Campylobacter - roles of flies in transmission,"Campylobateriosis is the most common food-associated disease, not only in Switzerland but worldwide. The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis. When temperatures rise, the number of flies increases and the incidence of campylobacteriosis rises at the same rate.",False,2019-02-25T00:00:00,2023-10-26T07:35:31,3.0,7.0,[2174]
121,1,F-2021-239,Campylobacter lanienae at the slaughterhouse,"Foodborne campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial enteritis in Germany. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.",False,2021-01-31T00:00:00,2024-02-14T08:25:03,3.0,8.0,[2174]
250,1,F-2023-033,Dimethylated Thioarsenates in rice,"Arsenic (As) occurrence in rice is a serious human health threat. Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: Open EFSA (europa.eu))",False,2023-11-09T07:40:13,2024-01-23T07:04:35,1.0,9.0,[2180]
233,1,F-2023-016,Social media and food safety risk,"Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.",True,2023-03-13T13:01:19,2025-02-12T07:11:17,2.0,50.0,[2179]
