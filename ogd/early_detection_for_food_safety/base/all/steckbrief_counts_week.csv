122,1,F-2021-240,Feed additive: 3-NOP in foods?,"Methane — a natural byproduct of digestion in ruminants — is released by cows into the atmosphere mostly through belching . The addition of 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) to the feed of dairy cows reduced their enteric methane emissions by about 25%.The compound inhibits an enzyme that is crucial to the final stage of methane synthesis in a cow’s rumen. When 3-NOP is fed to cattle, their methane production is inhibited.",False,2021-02-03T00:00:00,2022-09-16T11:04:54,1.0,5,[2646]
101,1,F-2021-147,<em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>ST283 in fish,"<em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause various infectious diseases. Previously. the pathogen was mainly known to cause severe neonatal infections (e.g., neonatal sepsis), but now <em>S. agalactiae</em> has also been linked to food, specifically the consumption of raw fish. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of severe invasive infections in Singapore, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, which could be traced back to sequence type (ST)283 of<em> S. agalactiae.</em> Epidemiological investigations revealed that the consumption of raw freshwater fish (tilapia) was the trigger. Follow-up investigations used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the prevalence of the bacterium more precisely. The result:<em> S. agalactiae</em> ST283 seems to have caused diseases in humans and farmed fish in Southeast Asia for decades. However, much remains unclear. If ST283 is transmitted exclusively from fish to humans, as was the case in the Singapore outbreak, then cases of<em> S. agalactiae </em>sepsis in Thailand and Laos are predominantly a food-borne disease. However, whether the transmission is from aquaculture to humans or vice versa, and whether there is an as yet unidentified reservoir, remains unknown. The germ could also be detected in tilapia from Brazil. Until now, the serotypes ST260 and ST927 were known in Brazil, but now ST283 also seems to be widespread. Based on import data of live tilapia from Singapore in 2014, a study suspects that the genotype was introduced into the country by the imported fish.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2025-07-28T08:42:32,2.0,17,[2653]
220,1,F-2023-003,PFAS in freshwater fish,"<strong>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)</strong> are widely detected in <strong>freshwater fish</strong> across the United States. A study from the US concludes, that locally caught freshwater fish are likely a significant <strong>source of exposure</strong> to <strong>perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)</strong> and other perfluorinated compounds.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fish testing in 2013–2015 had a median PFAS concentration of 11,800 ng/kg.",False,2023-01-23T09:19:51,2026-01-21T07:32:18,1.0,18,[2647]
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2022.2089625?needAccess=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Banach et al. (2022) </a>provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,43,[2648]
263,1,F-2024-011,"<em>Salmonella</em> Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","<em>Salmonella enterica</em> serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of <strong>antimicrobial resistance</strong>. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from <strong>poultry to humans</strong>, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,8,[2650]
