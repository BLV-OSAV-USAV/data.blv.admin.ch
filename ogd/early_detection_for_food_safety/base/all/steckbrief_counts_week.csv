263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,4.0,[1794]
115,1,F-2021-231,Salmonella Napoli - seasonality,"Individual cases salmonellosis, spread throughout Switzerland and attributable to a specific salmonella species, were frequent in 2019. However, the occurrence of S. Napoli is particularly striking. The cases that have been occurring since 2002 show a seasonal pattern. The weekly threshold defined by the FOPH was exceeded in 2019, triggering investigations which, however, did not reveal any indication of a possible cause of the illness mentioned above. At present, there are no indications of sources or causes of infection. According to literature studies, the pathogen occurs conspicuously often on rocket. However, further investigations also show an association with surface water. Water could thus be a central source, whether as irrigation water for salads and vegetables or as water associated with leisure activities (bathing, swimming, paddling, etc.). Animal products, on the other hand, seem to be of secondary importance. In contrast to other Salmonella serovars, this pathogen seems to cause more invasive diseases in addition to gastrointestinal diseases.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2024-02-26T11:08:34,1.0,34.0,[1794]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-11-08T08:10:41,1.0,51.0,[1793]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-08-30T08:15:03,1.0,28.0,[1795]
83,1,F-2021-123,PFAS in food packaging,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2024-10-08T08:29:00,1.0,48.0,[1795]
126,1,F-2021-273,"6PPD-Chinon - car tire abrasion, artificial turf","Exposure of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to stormwater causes unexplained acute annual mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban streams to reproduce. Investigating this phenomenon, researchers identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a ubiquitous antioxidant found in tyre rubber worldwide. Retrospective analyses of representative U.S. West Coast road runoff and stormwater-influenced streams revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD quinone (<0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unexpected risks of 6PPD antioxidants to this aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for residues derived from tyre rubber.",True,2021-03-01T00:00:00,2024-11-08T08:09:21,2.0,38.0,[1796]
