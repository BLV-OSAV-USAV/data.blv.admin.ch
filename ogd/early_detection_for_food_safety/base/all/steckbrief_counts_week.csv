30,1,F-2019-050,Microalgae as food,"Algae have great potential as a new food source. They grow quickly, can be produced in a water-saving way and do not require fertile soil. They are rich in protein, high in omega-3 fatty acids and contain essential vitamins and minerals. They could one day replace meat and fish. Currently, chlorella and spirulina are the main food supplements on the market.",False,2019-02-22T00:00:00,2024-02-29T08:17:23,1.0,5.0,[2164]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,2.0,51.0,[2157]
134,1,F-2021-281,Pheophorbides and other hazards in algae products,"Algae products with high levels of phophorbide (chlorophyll metabolite) have in the past (1970s) in Asia led to considerable health damage due to phototoxic effects in the consumers concerned. As a result, official limits were set for certain product groups in parts of Asia, but not so in the EU. It is therefore the responsibility of the food business operator to limit the content of pheophorbides in foods on the European market to a technologically unavoidable level in order to meet the requirements of European food law. The Japanese limit is 100 mg of pheophorbide present per 100 g, or 160 mg of cumulative pheophorbide (i.e. the amount of pheophorbide present plus the amount formed by chlorophyllase activity within a three-hour incubation at 37°C) per 100 g. In Taiwan, the limits only apply to dried seaweed with less than 7% residual moisture. They also do not apply to red and brown algae. According to the available literature, the minimum amount of pheophorbide that is photosensitising is 25 mg/day. Other chemical hazards - associated with algae - concern in particular iodine, cadmium, arsenic and lead, as well as microbiological hazards (see further documentation). Recent studies also show that red algae can be used in animal feed to reduce methane emissions from cattle stomachs. Chemical hazards from algae could find their way into the food chain via feed.",True,2021-06-30T00:00:00,2023-12-05T09:21:59,1.0,18.0,[2164]
138,1,F-2021-285,Brevetoxins - algal blooms,"Brevetoxins (Ptychodiscus toxins, PbTx) are neurotoxic algal toxins of the dinoflagellate species Karenia. The toxins are named after Karenia brevis. Karenia brevis is a marine alga and component of the phytoplankton of tropical regions and is regularly observed in the Caribbean and especially in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it occurs as one of the causative agents of ""red tides"", known as red algal blooms, which are formed by mass reproduction of these algae (Wikipedia). Other microalgae are also suspected of producing brevetoxins. This is the case with K. mikimotoi, K. bicuneiformis, Chattonella marina, C. antiqua, Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that cause irritation of the mucous membranes and respiratory tract. The effect is similar to that of ciguatoxin, but those are less toxic. Brevetoxins were first detected in France in November 2018 in mussels in Corsica (117 μg/kg digestive gland). The associated water samples for phytoplankton monitoring showed the presence of Karenia spp. (a genus of microalgae, some species of which produce brevetoxins).",False,2021-10-28T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:43:40,1.0,3.0,[2164]
202,1,F-2022-358,Ostreopsis - a new algae at European coasts,"In the summer of 2021, a new and unexpected phenomenon on the beaches of the Basque Country occured: a clinical picture reminiscent of an influenza-like syndrome, affecting entire families but also beach professionals (lifeguards, beach restaurant waiters, etc.). Water samples taken showed a high concentration of a microalga not visible to the naked eye called Ostreopsis. No serious cases were observed out of the 674 cases reported to the authorities in Bordeaux. Climate change and human activities are causing changes in the marine environment. It is in this context that new intoxications are appearing. These microalgae, invisible to the naked eye, grow on macroalgae and on the sea bed.They can also contaminate fish and shellfish through bioaccumulation.The particularity of Ostreopsis spp. is that it emits toxins in seawater and in particular at the level of the blooms. They are then aerosolised in the sea spray. One can therefore be intoxicated by the respiratory route without having set a foot into the water, through the skin when swimming, but also by ingestion when consuming contaminated products.

These microalgae produce toxins similar to palytoxin, responsible for :
Neurological signs: tingling, burning and headaches
ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and respiratory signs: runny nose, coughing, breathing difficulties,
Skin signs resembling urticaria,
Cardiac signs: tachycardia, high blood pressure,
Digestive signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
General signs: fever, muscle and joint pain.

128,1,F-2022-275,Bioplastic as packaging material,"As the environmental impact of the growing tide of plastic in the oceans and on land becomes more apparent, scientists are scrambling to create alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. But it has proven tricky to make bioplastics that are cheap, strong, water-resistant and break down quickly when their use is over. The race for renewable plastics has led to bioplastics made from corn starch, sugar cane, potatoes, coffee grounds, food waste, algae and wood waste powder.",False,2022-01-07T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:17:32,2.0,3.0,[2156]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,[2154]
