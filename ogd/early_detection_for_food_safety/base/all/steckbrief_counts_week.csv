118,2,F-2020-236,Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4h - hypervirulent,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that comprises 14 serotypes, of which serovar 4h is a novel serotype recently reported. Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.",False,2020-12-22T00:00:00,2022-09-12T16:08:04,1.0,4.0,"[2013, 2011]"
232,2,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-02-24T07:25:43,1.0,37.0,"[2013, 2011]"
120,2,F-2021-238,Listeria monocytogenes serotyp 4b ST6 in cheese,"An outbreak of human listeriosis in Switzerland was attributed to persistent environmental contamination of a cheese factory with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b, sequence type 6, cluster type 7488. Whole genome sequencing was used to match clinical isolates with a cheese sample and with samples from numerous sites within the production environment.",False,2021-01-04T00:00:00,2024-10-17T06:54:42,1.0,11.0,"[2013, 2011]"
13,1,F-2018-029,Cyclospora,"Cyclospora infection is an intestinal disease caused by a unicellular parasite. Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected. The list of outbreaks is long and seems to have been increasing in recent years.",True,2018-12-17T00:00:00,2024-11-25T11:23:25,1.0,19.0,[2014]
60,1,F-2019-099,"Pet food (Salmonella, Listeria)","Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) Salmonella serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with Salmonella are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).",False,2019-08-05T00:00:00,2022-09-16T11:14:10,1.0,3.0,[2011]
31,1,F-2019-051,Campylobacter - roles of flies in transmission,"Campylobateriosis is the most common food-associated disease, not only in Switzerland but worldwide. The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis. When temperatures rise, the number of flies increases and the incidence of campylobacteriosis rises at the same rate.",False,2019-02-25T00:00:00,2023-10-26T07:35:31,1.0,6.0,[2007]
121,1,F-2021-239,Campylobacter lanienae at the slaughterhouse,"Foodborne campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial enteritis in Germany. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.",False,2021-01-31T00:00:00,2024-02-14T08:25:03,1.0,7.0,[2007]
