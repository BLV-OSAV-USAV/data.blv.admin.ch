The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced.

134,1,F-2021-281,Pheophorbides and other hazards in algae products,"Algae products with high levels of phophorbide (chlorophyll metabolite) have in the past (1970s) in Asia led to considerable health damage due to phototoxic effects in the consumers concerned. As a result, official limits were set for certain product groups in parts of Asia, but not so in the EU. It is therefore the responsibility of the food business operator to limit the content of pheophorbides in foods on the European market to a technologically unavoidable level in order to meet the requirements of European food law. The Japanese limit is 100 mg of pheophorbide present per 100 g, or 160 mg of cumulative pheophorbide (i.e. the amount of pheophorbide present plus the amount formed by chlorophyllase activity within a three-hour incubation at 37°C) per 100 g. In Taiwan, the limits only apply to dried seaweed with less than 7% residual moisture. They also do not apply to red and brown algae. According to the available literature, the minimum amount of pheophorbide that is photosensitising is 25 mg/day. Other chemical hazards - associated with algae - concern in particular iodine, cadmium, arsenic and lead, as well as microbiological hazards (see further documentation). Recent studies also show that red algae can be used in animal feed to reduce methane emissions from cattle stomachs. Chemical hazards from algae could find their way into the food chain via feed.",True,2021-06-30T00:00:00,2023-12-05T09:21:59,1.0,18.0,[2164]

Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A).

202,1,F-2022-358,Ostreopsis - a new algae at European coasts,"In the summer of 2021, a new and unexpected phenomenon on the beaches of the Basque Country occured: a clinical picture reminiscent of an influenza-like syndrome, affecting entire families but also beach professionals (lifeguards, beach restaurant waiters, etc.). Water samples taken showed a high concentration of a microalga not visible to the naked eye called Ostreopsis. No serious cases were observed out of the 674 cases reported to the authorities in Bordeaux. Climate change and human activities are causing changes in the marine environment. It is in this context that new intoxications are appearing. These microalgae, invisible to the naked eye, grow on macroalgae and on the sea bed.They can also contaminate fish and shellfish through bioaccumulation.The particularity of Ostreopsis spp. is that it emits toxins in seawater and in particular at the level of the blooms. They are then aerosolised in the sea spray. One can therefore be intoxicated by the respiratory route without having set a foot into the water, through the skin when swimming, but also by ingestion when consuming contaminated products.

These microalgae produce toxins similar to palytoxin, responsible for :
Neurological signs: tingling, burning and headaches
ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and respiratory signs: runny nose, coughing, breathing difficulties,
Skin signs resembling urticaria,
Cardiac signs: tachycardia, high blood pressure,
Digestive signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
General signs: fever, muscle and joint pain.

138,1,F-2021-285,Brevetoxins - algal blooms,"Brevetoxins (Ptychodiscus toxins, PbTx) are neurotoxic algal toxins of the dinoflagellate species Karenia. The toxins are named after Karenia brevis. Karenia brevis is a marine alga and component of the phytoplankton of tropical regions and is regularly observed in the Caribbean and especially in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it occurs as one of the causative agents of ""red tides"", known as red algal blooms, which are formed by mass reproduction of these algae (Wikipedia). Other microalgae are also suspected of producing brevetoxins. This is the case with K. mikimotoi, K. bicuneiformis, Chattonella marina, C. antiqua, Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that cause irritation of the mucous membranes and respiratory tract. The effect is similar to that of ciguatoxin, but those are less toxic. Brevetoxins were first detected in France in November 2018 in mussels in Corsica (117 μg/kg digestive gland). The associated water samples for phytoplankton monitoring showed the presence of Karenia spp. (a genus of microalgae, some species of which produce brevetoxins).",False,2021-10-28T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:43:40,1.0,3.0,[2164]

They infect people of all ages, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. The clinical symptoms of sapovirus gastroenteritis are indistinguishable from those caused by noroviruses, so laboratory diagnosis is essential to identify the causative agent. Sapovirus infections are a public health concern, causing acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide in both outbreaks and sporadic cases. Outbreaks often occur in semi-enclosed environments. Outbreaks due to food-borne transmission of sapoviruses have also been reported. Sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse. Currently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are widely used for the detection of sapoviruses from clinical samples because of their high sensitivity and broad reactivity and the lack of sensitive assays for antigen detection or cell culture systems for the detection of infectious viruses. Sapoviruses were first discovered in 1976 by electron microscopy in diarrhoeal samples from humans. To date, sapoviruses have also been detected in various animals: pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions and bats (Oka et al. 2015). Sapovirus is thought to be spread from person to person, through sewage infiltration into drinking water sources and via contaminated food.

83,1,F-2021-123,PFAS in food packaging,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2024-10-08T08:29:00,2.0,48.0,[2151]

Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change.
