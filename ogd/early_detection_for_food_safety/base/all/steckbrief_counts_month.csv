21,3,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish.

8,3,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-11-12T07:00:52,1.0,63.0,"[2533, 2490, 2495]"
23,1,F-2019-043,Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27.0,[2497]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,1.0,22.0,[2534]
296,1,F-2025-013,Helminths in foods,"The FAO expert meeting on microbiological risk assessment of helminths in foods  reviewed recent scientific developments associated with foodborne helminths, specifically including information on disease burden, attribution to food commodities, analytical detection and diagnostic methods and control measures. These commodity included: Fish and Shellfish, Meat, and Fruits and Vegetables. For the majority of helminths, severity of infection varies, and outbreaks are rarely reported due to lack of pathognomonic signs (symptoms are non-specific), long incubation periods, and chronicity of disease, resulting in difficulties in traceback and source attribution. Helminths are complex organisms, often with multi-stage life cycles, environmental stages, and multiple hosts. Broadly, foodborne helminths can be classified as cestodes (tapeworms), nematodes (roundworms), and trematodes (flukes). Currently, many foodborne helminths remain neglected. Climate change will likely result in increased transmission of some helminths in some regions. This will be due to improvements in the survival of helminth eggs (oocytes) and other helminth transmission stages in the environment, increased speed of parasite development, and alterations, potentially expansions, of the distribution of both intermediate and definitive hosts. Consumer behaviour, such as consumption of raw or undercooked meat, fish, shellfish, or fruits and vegetables, may also affect human exposure to foodborne helminths. In all cases, use of good agricultural practices and good hygiene practices are necessary to reduce transmission of foodborne helminths.",False,2025-11-10T08:20:43,2025-11-10T13:45:14,1.0,7.0,[2526]
136,1,F-2021-283,Asparagopsis taxiformis as a fodder,"Cows exhale the powerful greenhouse gas methane. One of the ways to limit methane emissions from cows is to feed them the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis. This seaweed contains high concentrations of bromoform, a substance that counteracts the formation of methane in the cow's rumen. Studies by Wageningen University & Research show that bromoform can get into the cow's milk and urine. Bromoform in its pure form is harmful to health. There are limits to the maximum amount of bromoform in drinking water, but no such limits for food.",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-08-26T14:56:34,1.0,5.0,[2525]
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness.

178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-07-28T07:15:51,2.0,30.0,[2538]
35,1,F-2019-055,Nanoparticles in foods,"Nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the food industry to modulate various aspects of food. As a result, man-made nanoparticles are increasingly being used as functional ingredients in foods and beverages. They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed. One study shows how nanoparticles can positively influence bacteria of the digestive tract. They speak of ""probiotic nanoparticles"". Nanoparticles are also already being used in pharmacy, for example to precisely transport substances to where they are needed.",True,2019-10-18T00:00:00,2025-07-11T06:41:30,1.0,23.0,[2503]
236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-10-09T09:07:44,1.0,20.0,[2524]
181,1,F-2022-337,Safety of probiotics,"The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).

Plants produce them as defensive substances against predators. Of more than 660 known PAs and similar compounds, the 1,2-unsaturated PAs in particular have a potential to be harmful to health.
