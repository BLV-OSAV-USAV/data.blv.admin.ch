Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt.

Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:04:04,1.0,66.0,"[1908, 1913, 1927]"

These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change.

211,3,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found.

Some members of the B. cereus group can cause two distinct forms of food-borne illness: Firstly, the diarrheal syndrome that is linked to three enterotoxins - Hbl, Nhe and CytK - and secondly, the emetic syndrome caused by cereulide toxin preformed in food. B. cytotoxicus was isolated for the first time in the context of a severe outbreak of diarrheal disease leading to fatalities and was described as a species in 2013. The organism harbors a specific variant of the gene encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin K designated cytK-1. It has been reported that the cytotoxin K variant CytK-1 confers substantially higher toxicity than CytK-2. B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and might be missed using routine diagnostic screening for B. cereus group organisms at 30°C. Targeted screening at temperatures of at least 37°C has shown that dried food matrices containing potato starch very commonly harbor B. cytotoxicus.For instance, a recent study found a prevalence of 95% in mashed potato powder sold at retail level in Switzerland. Recent reports from the UK suggest that B. cytotoxicus also occurs in association with insect-based foods, which have recently gained popularity.

Alternaria spp. also infest other vegetables, namely tomatoes. They produce mycotoxins, with the 'big 5', namely alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT), being particularly problematic. These toxins have been detected in cauliflower. Other toxins are known. No maximum levels have been set for these toxins in food across Europe. The problem is being addressed; the focus of interest so far has been on tomatoes [1,2,3]. The first symptoms of cauliflower infestation are the formation of small black dots on the surface of an inflorescence. The FSVO does not consider such an incipient infestation to be a health concern. It cannot be assumed that an incipient infestation (visible through individual black dots on the surface) is accompanied by a contamination of the entire inflorescence that is hazardous to health. However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested. The question arises as to how the infestation progresses in cabbage vegetables, whose tissue is relatively firm, and whether there is a correlation between visible symptoms and a potential health risk.

Although pathogenicity has not yet been clearly demonstrated, there is much to suggest that P. alcalifaciens, for example, can cause diarrhoea. Both developing and industrialised countries can be affected by outbreaks caused by Providencia spp.. Insufficient personal hygiene, inadequate food storage conditions and cross-contamination during preparation are often cited as causes of foodborne infections. In view of global trade flows and rising temperatures due to climate change, food on the European market could also be increasingly contaminated with Providencia spp. and cause outbreaks.",False,2025-01-31T07:32:58,2025-01-31T11:20:10,1.0,4.0,[1956]
48,1,F-2019-078,Antimicrobial resistance in plant-based foods,"Antibiotics are essential drugs. They are used to treat diseases caused by bacteria. However, antibiotics increasingly lose their efficacy because bacteria are becoming resistant. In recent years, antibiotics have become less effective. In order to ensure their efficacy in the long run and to stem the spread of resistant bacteria, the Federal Council has adopted the comprehensive Strategy on Antibiotic Resistance (StAR), which is now being implemented in various fields. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens can also be found in foods. They can lead to increased resistance in humans. Resistance can be enhanced not only through animal products but also plant-based products. However, we have far less information on plant-based products than on animal food products. Salads are popular foods in a balanced and healthy diet. They are often sold in a ready-tp-eat packging (plastic wrapping). It is known that such fresh products can be contaminated with hygiene-relevant germs. Different research groups have shown that these products contain germs that are resistant to antibiotics.",True,2019-04-16T00:00:00,2024-10-01T16:49:39,2.0,34.0,[1883]
129,1,F-2021-276,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia albertii,"Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003. This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live. Interactions between raccoons and other animals, such as wild mice and wild boar, may also be possible (Hinenoya et al. 2020).",True,2021-04-09T00:00:00,2025-01-27T07:37:47,2.0,33.0,[1896]
62,1,F-2019-101,Chronic wasting disease,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion-related transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids, including deer, elk, reindeer and sika deer. CWD has been confirmed in at least 26 US states, three Canadian provinces, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The number of cases has been increasing for the past 5 years. US scientists assume a possible risk of infection for humans, by analogy with BSE. They conclude that the available data suggest that the incidence of CWD in cervids is increasing and that there is potential for transmission to humans and subsequent human disease. Given the long incubation period of prion-associated diseases, consideration should be given to improving public health measures to prevent human exposure to CWD prions and thus reduce the potential risk to humans. This would reduce the likelihood of a BSE-like event in the coming years.",False,2019-08-07T00:00:00,2025-01-21T07:38:59,1.0,12.0,[1899]

Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential.

Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods.
