51,2,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. <a href=""https://www.tagblatt.ch/wirtschaft/das-ist-die-protein-pflanze-der-zukunft-thurgauer-unternehmer-ueber-den-wunderbaum-mit-potenzial-ld.1215367"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Interview in the Tagblatt</a>.

211,2,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2022.2089625?needAccess=true"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Banach et al.

101,1,F-2021-147,<em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>ST283 in fish,"<em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause various infectious diseases. Previously. the pathogen was mainly known to cause severe neonatal infections (e.g., neonatal sepsis), but now <em>S. agalactiae</em> has also been linked to food, specifically the consumption of raw fish. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of severe invasive infections in Singapore, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, which could be traced back to sequence type (ST)283 of<em> S. agalactiae.</em> Epidemiological investigations revealed that the consumption of raw freshwater fish (tilapia) was the trigger. Follow-up investigations used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the prevalence of the bacterium more precisely. The result:<em> S. agalactiae</em> ST283 seems to have caused diseases in humans and farmed fish in Southeast Asia for decades. However, much remains unclear. If ST283 is transmitted exclusively from fish to humans, as was the case in the Singapore outbreak, then cases of<em> S. agalactiae </em>sepsis in Thailand and Laos are predominantly a food-borne disease. However, whether the transmission is from aquaculture to humans or vice versa, and whether there is an as yet unidentified reservoir, remains unknown. The germ could also be detected in tilapia from Brazil. Until now, the serotypes ST260 and ST927 were known in Brazil, but now ST283 also seems to be widespread. Based on import data of live tilapia from Singapore in 2014, a study suspects that the genotype was introduced into the country by the imported fish.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2025-07-28T08:42:32,2.0,17.0,[2653]
86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2026-01-14T16:31:44,1.0,67.0,[2659]

They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed.

34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport.

These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A).

These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change.
