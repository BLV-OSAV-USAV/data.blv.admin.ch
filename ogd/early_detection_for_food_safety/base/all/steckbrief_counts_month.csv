95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-03-31T07:34:09,1.0,76.0,[2147]
239,1,F-2023-022,Helicobacter pylori in raw and ready-to-eat meat,"Helicobacter pylori, classified as a class-I carcinogen, is one of the leading medical pathogens of global concern associated mainly with the development of gastric adenocarcinomas and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas; nevertheless, its prevalence in food especially meat and meat products is not fully covered. A study investigated the prevalence, molecular characterization, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clarithromycin-, and metronidazole-resistant H. pylori isolated from raw and ready-to-eat meat samples retailed in Mansoura city, Egypt. The results showed a widespread contamination of examined raw and ready-to-eat meat product samples with multidrug-resistant H. pylori isolates, which could constitute a tremendous public health hazard.",True,2023-07-26T11:34:05,2025-03-24T08:10:39,1.0,35.0,[2149]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,2.0,51.0,[2157]
147,1,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,10.0,[2142]
173,1,F-2021-325,Sapovirus - zoonotic agent,"Sapoviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They belong to the genus Sapoviruses within the family Caliciviridae. They infect people of all ages, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. The clinical symptoms of sapovirus gastroenteritis are indistinguishable from those caused by noroviruses, so laboratory diagnosis is essential to identify the causative agent. Sapovirus infections are a public health concern, causing acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide in both outbreaks and sporadic cases. Outbreaks often occur in semi-enclosed environments. Outbreaks due to food-borne transmission of sapoviruses have also been reported. Sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse. Currently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are widely used for the detection of sapoviruses from clinical samples because of their high sensitivity and broad reactivity and the lack of sensitive assays for antigen detection or cell culture systems for the detection of infectious viruses. Sapoviruses were first discovered in 1976 by electron microscopy in diarrhoeal samples from humans. To date, sapoviruses have also been detected in various animals: pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions and bats (Oka et al. 2015). Sapovirus is thought to be spread from person to person, through sewage infiltration into drinking water sources and via contaminated food. Among food-borne transmissions, seafood is a recognised source of sapovirus infection.",False,2021-11-10T00:00:00,2025-03-21T08:43:59,1.0,5.0,[2143]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-11-26T14:04:08,2.0,29.0,[2151]
83,1,F-2021-123,PFAS in food packaging,"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are used in numerous industrial processes and consumer products, such as fire extinguishing materials. They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2024-10-08T08:29:00,2.0,48.0,[2151]
128,1,F-2022-275,Bioplastic as packaging material,"As the environmental impact of the growing tide of plastic in the oceans and on land becomes more apparent, scientists are scrambling to create alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. But it has proven tricky to make bioplastics that are cheap, strong, water-resistant and break down quickly when their use is over. The race for renewable plastics has led to bioplastics made from corn starch, sugar cane, potatoes, coffee grounds, food waste, algae and wood waste powder.",False,2022-01-07T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:17:32,2.0,3.0,[2156]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,[2154]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53.0,[2148]
