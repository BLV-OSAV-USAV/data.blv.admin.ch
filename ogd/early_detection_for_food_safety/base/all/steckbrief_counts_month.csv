140,4,F-2021-287,Human gut microbiome,"The human gut microbiome is a diversified, resilient, immunostabilised, metabolically active and physiologically essential component of the human body. Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).",True,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:20:51,1.75,28.0,"[1841, 1833, 1845, 1849]"

257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another study found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2024-09-30T09:20:31,1.0,24.0,[1853]
235,1,F-2023-018,Detrimental impact of cellulose derivatives food additive on the gut microbiota,"Additive derivated from cellulose - such as microcrystalline cellulose (E 460), powdered cellulose (E 460), methyl cellulose (E 461), ethyl cellulose (E 462), hydroxypropyl cellulose (E 463), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (E 464), ethyl methyl cellulose (E 465), sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (E 466) and enzymatically hydrolysed carboxy methyl cellulose (E 469) - are often used in the food industry because of thier thechnological properties. However, since several years, these additives are controversial because of their potential adverse health effects. The EFSA stated in 2018 that they would be no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels for the unmodified and modified celluloses. However, results of a randomized Controlled-Feeding Study of Dietary Emulsifier Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) published in 2021 support the notion that the broad use of CMC in processed foods may be contributing to increased prevalence of an array of chronic inflammatory diseases by altering the gut microbiome and metabolome. Because these additives are commonly used in meat-alternatives and regular consumer of these product would be more exposed to these additives, increasing the risk of developing inflammatory diseases.",False,2023-04-20T13:45:41,2024-05-29T16:51:44,2.0,6.0,[1841]

There is already a high baseline load of TFA in many water bodies with some regional hotspots. This background paper presents current data and estimates on sources, input pathways, loads, impacts and measures on TFA. It gives an outlook on first activities and options to comprehensively minimise TFA inputs to the environment.

Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,2.0,52.0,[1845]
75,1,F-2019-115,Cyanobacteria,"Cyanobacteria are microorganisms found mainly in eutrophic freshwaters, i.e. waters enriched with nutrients. While the impact of climate change has an impact on the spread of cyanobacteria, human activity, both urban and rural (fertiliser runoff, sewage, etc.) is also crucial. Cyanobacteria can release toxins some of which are very dangerous to humans. The main circumstances and routes of exposure to these toxins are ingestion of contaminated water, inhalation, or skin contact during recreational water activities (swimming, water sports). Consumption of fruits or vegetables irrigated with contaminated water or consumption of fish and shellfish can also be a source of exposure to cyanotoxins. The effects of cyanotoxins on human health are varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are most commonly reported, but eye or skin damage (irritation and rash), myalgia, liver and kidney damage are also often described. On the other hand, the involvement of these toxins in the development of chronic diseases, especially neurological diseases, remains the subject of scientific controversy.",False,2019-10-17T00:00:00,2024-11-13T07:08:58,1.0,15.0,[1847]
266,1,F-2024-014,Poor diet increases cancer risk - scientists uncover missing link,"A research team has unearthed new findings which may help explain the connection between cancer risk and poor diet, as well as common diseases like diabetes, which arise from poor diet. The insights gained from this study hold promise for advancing cancer prevention strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging. Poor diet can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. However, experts have not yet found any firm causative links between individual dietary components and cancer. A new study has discovered that methylglyoxal — which is produced when glucose is broken down in cells — may help explain the link between poor diet and cancer. They suggest that a long-term poor diet leads to an increase in the production of methylglyoxal, which switches off cancer-preventing genes, increasing cancer risk.",False,2024-04-23T07:23:40,2024-04-23T15:58:30,1.0,5.0,[1870]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources.

Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no.

95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2024-12-11T18:54:27,1.0,72.0,[1840]

The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis.
