34,3,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-07-10T06:38:46,1.0,55.0,"[2246, 2273, 2222]"

Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods.

The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change.

The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products.

211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks.

Additionally, the wastewater draining from massive pools of sewage sludge has the potential to play a role in more sustainable agriculture (Science of The Total Environment, 20.01.2023). However, this practice is not without risks as some of some of these wastewater sources might be susceptible to contamination with microbial pathogensFor instance, surveys have found Listeria monocytogenes in water, soil, vegetation, and farm animal feces around the world. The frequency at which this pathogen is present in water sources is dependent on multiple factors, including the season, surrounding land use, presence of animals, and physicochemical water parameters. Understanding the survival duration of L. monocytogenes in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors. Understanding the pathogen’s ability to remain infectious is key to understanding how L. monocytogenes impacts produce outbreaks and, ultimately, consumers’ health.Moreover, the German federal institute for risk assessment (BfR) has published a risk assessment of transmission of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Toxoplasma gondii to humans related to using reclaimed wastewater in agriculture where they recommend to only use irrigation water of a quality comparable to drinking water for watering plants that are usually consumed raw.",True,2023-02-28T11:35:21,2025-07-07T15:50:17,1.0,31.0,[2243]
93,1,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used.
