8,3,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-08-19T08:04:46,1.33,58.0,"[2392, 2389, 2417]"
95,2,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,85.0,"[2396, 2385]"

Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls.

23,1,F-2019-043,Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27.0,[2402]

They are also popular in food packaging because the substances are water and fat repellent. However, in animal studies, some of them have been shown to be liver-damaging, toxic to reproduction and probably carcinogenic. PFAS are of particular concern because, unlike other common contaminants that pass quickly through the human body, they can linger for years and thus accumulate cumulatively. This property has given them the name ""forever chemicals"". PFASs can also enter the food chain through environmental pollution, for example when plants are supplied with contaminated water or grown in contaminated soil, such as near factories or places where products containing PFASs have been used for firefighting. From mid-2020, Denmark will be the first country to ban the use of all PFASs in food packaging.",False,2021-06-17T00:00:00,2024-10-08T08:29:00,2.0,48.0,[2426]

Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-09-18T07:52:29,1.0,28.0,[2429]

Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates.

36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-09-08T13:38:04,3.0,45.0,[2383]

285,1,F-2025-002,Blastocystis spp.,"Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in human  faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with  the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.  Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study  showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity  of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of  asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without  symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,  weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections  can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even  though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immunosuppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.Contaminated water sources can lead to outbreaks of parasitic infections like Blastocystis sp., significantly straining healthcare systems and impacting community health. A systematic review analyzed 24 studies with 2,451 water samples from 15 countries, finding an overall prevalence of 18.8% for Blastocystis sp., with the highest infection rate in wastewater (35.5%) and notable levels in tap water (19.1%).",True,2025-02-03T16:15:44,2025-08-08T08:15:21,1.0,18.0,[2421]
