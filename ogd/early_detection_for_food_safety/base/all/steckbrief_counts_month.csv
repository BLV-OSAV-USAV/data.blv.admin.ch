129,2,F-2021-276,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia albertii,"Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003. This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live. Interactions between raccoons and other animals, such as wild mice and wild boar, may also be possible (Hinenoya et al. 2020).",True,2021-04-09T00:00:00,2025-01-27T07:37:47,1.0,33.0,"[2025, 1989]"

The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish.

Consumption of fruits or vegetables irrigated with contaminated water or consumption of fish and shellfish can also be a source of exposure to cyanotoxins. The effects of cyanotoxins on human health are varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are most commonly reported, but eye or skin damage (irritation and rash), myalgia, liver and kidney damage are also often described.

180,1,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T10:59:16,1.0,30.0,[2004]

Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus.

Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.",False,2021-01-31T00:00:00,2024-02-14T08:25:03,1.0,7.0,[2007]
