Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals.

The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (<em>tetrahydrocannabinol</em>), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-need-know-and-what-were-working-find-out-about-products-containing-cannabis-or-cannabis"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FDA warns</a> of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. <em>Cannabigerol</em> (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice.

Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall.

In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria.

It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing <em>E. coli</em> (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.67.204"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Murakami et al., 2014</a>).

However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: <a href=""https://open.efsa.europa.eu/questions/EFSA-Q-2021-00496"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Open EFSA (europa.eu)</a>)",False,2023-11-09T07:40:13,2024-01-23T07:04:35,1.0,9.0,"[1856, 933, 1027, 1014, 2180]"
180,5,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose &amp; Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T10:59:16,1.4,30.0,"[147, 185, 429, 209, 2004]"
275,5,F-2024-023,Lab-grown food,"Lab-grown food, also known as cultured or synthetic food, encompasses a variety of products that are produced using biotechnological methods rather than traditional agricultural practices. Some examples include cultured meat, derived from animal cells grown in a controlled environment, and lab-grown vegetables and fruits produced through tissue culture techniques. While this technology holds promise in addressing food security and environmental concerns, there are potential risks associated with its development and consumption.One significant concern is related to the safety and regulatory aspects of lab-grown food. Since these products are relatively new, there is limited data on their long-term health effects. Ensuring that the growth medium and conditions are free from contaminants and pathogens is crucial to avoid health risks to consumers. Additionally, there may be unknown allergens or unintended health consequences that could arise from consuming these novel food products.In laboratories, various types of food can be grown using biotechnological methods. Some of the most notable examples include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cultured Meat:</strong> Also known as lab-grown meat or clean meat, this involves growing animal muscle tissue from stem cells in a controlled environment. It aims to replicate the taste, texture, and nutritional profile of traditional meat without the need for raising and slaughtering animals.</li>
<li><strong>Lab-Grown Fish and Seafood:</strong> Similar to cultured meat, lab-grown fish and seafood products are produced by cultivating fish cells in vitro. This technology offers a sustainable alternative to wild-caught or farmed seafood, potentially reducing overfishing and environmental impacts associated with traditional aquaculture.</li>
<li><strong>Lab-Grown Vegetables and Fruits:</strong> Tissue culture techniques can be used to propagate plants under sterile conditions, allowing for the production of uniform and disease-free plants. This method is particularly useful for propagating rare or endangered plant species and can also be applied to produce specific plant parts, such as fruits or seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Algae and Microbial Cultures:</strong> Algae and certain types of microorganisms can be cultivated in laboratories for their nutritional value and potential applications in food products. Algal biomass can be processed into oils, proteins, and other valuable nutrients.</li>
<li><strong>Lab-Grown Dairy Products:</strong> Researchers are exploring methods to produce dairy proteins, such as casein and whey, using microbial fermentation or bioengineering techniques. These proteins can be used as ingredients in dairy alternatives or other food products.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Protein Sources:</strong> Beyond meat and seafood, labs are also investigating other sources of protein such as insects and fungi. These organisms can be cultured and processed into protein-rich ingredients for human consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Cacao and coffee : </strong>This process involves the cultivation of cacao cells, which grow, replicate and then differentiate to produce the various components needed for cocoa-based products, such as chocolate.</li>

Acute symptoms affect the muscles, nervous and cardiovascular systems. These may lead to complete atrioventricular block, convulsions, mental confusion, agitation, syncope and respiratory depression.

The food chain is one of the main drivers of MDR transmission, as food is not sterile and can usually have microbiological contamination or become contaminated at certain stages of the food chain (i.e. cross-contamination, recontamination). Indeed, the food chain can act as a driver for MDR spread, enabling the survival or even multiplication of MDR pathogens. MDR transmission is not exclusive to foods of animal origin or fish; plant foods can also harbour MDR microorganisms, as vegetables can be contaminated during primary production by water contaminated with faecal material from wastewater from surrounding farms. In general, pathogens are not common in food and the main risk arises from the high prevalence of non-pathogenic microorganisms that can transfer AMR genes to other microbial species, including foodborne pathogens.
