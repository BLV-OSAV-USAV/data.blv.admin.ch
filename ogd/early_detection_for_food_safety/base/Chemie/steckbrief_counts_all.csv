The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (<em>tetrahydrocannabinol</em>), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-need-know-and-what-were-working-find-out-about-products-containing-cannabis-or-cannabis"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FDA warns</a> of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. <em>Cannabigerol</em> (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice.

Several studies have investigated this hypothesis but have come to different conclusions. A connection between high nitrite intake from meat products and an increased cancer risk can neither be clearly proven nor disproven. Moreover, it is not only the consumption of a food that plays a role in the development of the disease, but the interaction between all lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette consumption, etc. Nitrite is not only absorbed through cured meat products, but is also formed as a degradation product of nitrate-containing foods in the body. These are mainly plant foods, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the supply of nitrogen to the plant. Examples of nitrate-containing foods are salads and vegetables such as rocket, spinach, kohlrabi, beetroot and radish. Furthermore, nitrate converted into nitrite can react with amines, amides or amino acids (present for example in the gastrointestinal tract or in the production of meat products) to form nitrosamines.

Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers.

Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed.

250,5,F-2023-033,Dimethylated Thioarsenates in rice,"Arsenic (As) occurrence in rice is a serious human health threat. Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: <a href=""https://open.efsa.europa.eu/questions/EFSA-Q-2021-00496"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Open EFSA (europa.eu)</a>)",False,2023-11-09T07:40:13,2024-01-23T07:04:35,1.0,9.0,"[1856, 933, 1027, 1014, 2180]"
180,5,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose &amp; Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T10:59:16,1.4,30.0,"[147, 185, 429, 209, 2004]"
150,5,F-2022-298,Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome,"New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria,<em> E. coli (Escherichia coli)</em> and <em>E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis)</em>. Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as <em>E. faecalis</em> that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of <em>E. coli</em> and <em>E. faecalis</em> to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (<a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/aru-ssp062321.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Eurek Alert</a>).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible ""emerging risk"". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the <em>Klebsiella</em> genus, such as <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of <em>Klebsiella spp</em>. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.",True,2022-05-31T00:00:00,2025-10-31T09:29:05,1.0,32.0,"[1273, 1450, 69, 323, 1112]"

Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health.

However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested.

Dysregulated genes were associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine, neurochemical and insulin signalling. Oxt was the only gene with metabolic, inflammatory, and neurological relevance that was upregulated by both soybean oil diets compared to both control diets.

236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-10-09T09:07:44,1.0,20.0,[2118]

It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022).
