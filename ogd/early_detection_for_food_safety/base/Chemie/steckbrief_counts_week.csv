36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-05-26T06:47:48,2.0,44,[2325]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.",True,2019-05-27T00:00:00,2025-03-07T07:40:51,1.0,112,[2329]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-08-05T07:52:44,1.0,56,[2331]
21,1,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-07-12T14:11:49,1.0,10,[2331]
160,1,F-2021-309,Human milk donation and associated health risks,"In the absence of a lactarium in French-speaking Switzerland, young mothers give, sell, buy, or receive breast milk. There are platforms for these exchanges on social networks, but they do not seem to be supervised by health professionals. The journalist in this article raises the microbiological and toxicological risks that the failure to respect certain basic sanitary rules (use of medication and bacterial contamination by Salmonella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus) may represent for breast milk and therefore for the newborn. In 2022, a first lactarium will be opened, it is possible that these platforms will or will not cease to exist, but the question concerning the professional supervision of this issue remains if they continue to exist.",False,2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-01-13T15:13:17,1.0,7,[2330]
