12,1,F-2018-028,Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp.,"Infections with Aspergillus spp. show a high morbidity and mortality rate in risk groups. Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance. Studies have shown that resistant Aspergillus spp. are also resistant to medicinal azoles, emerging from fungicides.",True,2018-04-13T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:22:19,1.0,16,[1977]
