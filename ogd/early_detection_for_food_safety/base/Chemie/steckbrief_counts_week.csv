8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-09-30T08:28:10,1.0,48.0,[1740]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-08-30T08:15:03,2.0,28.0,[1725]
196,1,F-2022-352,PFOS in meat,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (conjugate base perfluorooctanesulfonate) is an anthropogenic (man-made) fluorosurfactant, now regarded as a global pollutant. There is a major focus on PFOS hotspot contaminations in DK right now. During the spring and summer a site previously used for training fires and firefighting has been investigated. A field close to the site was used for grassing by cows owned by 20 families. Five cows each summer has been grassing there. PFOS is analysed in the meat at concentrations from 156 to 230 ng/g in four samples from four cows. Also grass was analyzed from the area up to 165 ng/g and water in the stream showed very high levels. The theory is that rainwater is running off in the direction of the field and the stream. So the cows have had the intake both from the water in the stream and from the grass. About 187 local consumers, that have eaten the meat through the years, have had the blood analyzed for PFOS. There are a big variation of PFOS in the blood. From 1,1 ng/ml up to 500 ng/ml. Doctors at the nearby hospital will follow the people who has high levels in the blood and try to help them. They will now try to use a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that is thought to increase the secretion of PFOS. 145 other areas around DK, where use of PFOS has been going on, will now be investigated.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-09-04T06:40:26,2.0,6.0,[1725]
137,1,F-2021-284,Fish oil as a food supplement,"Currently, fish oil supplements are indicated for patients with elevated plasma triglycerides to reduce cardiovascular risk. Due to the high prevalence of elevated triglycerides in the population, they can be prescribed frequently. It is worth noting that low-dose omega-3 fatty acids are available over the counter. Some clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. People with this disorder are five times more likely to have a stroke. Lombardi et al (2021) found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared to placebo, with an incidence rate of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.54; p<0.001).",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-09-12T11:03:19,1.0,4.0,[1727]
27,1,F-2019-047,Dietary supplements,"According to Menu CH, around 50% of Swiss people regularly consume food supplements containing vitamins, minerals, trace elements or other substances. The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed. Consumers do not necessarily consult a doctor or a poison control centre, and there is no nutrivigilance system in Switzerland.Legal framework Switzerland: Most important: General food law provisions on safety and protection against deception, VNem, Ordinance on Novel Food, certain plants and substances may not be used in food (VLpH and VZVM). No nutrivigilance system (unlike France), no notification legal framework EU: Largely non-harmonised. Certain countries have specific regulations (maximum quantities, plant lists), some notification, few countries with nutrivigilance systems.",True,2019-02-11T00:00:00,2024-06-11T07:55:09,1.0,18.0,[1737]
