86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2026-01-14T16:31:44,1.0,69,[2695]
165,1,F-2022-316,Marine toxins: an emerging risk in Europe?,"Ciguatera is the most common form of marine biotoxin food poisoning in the world, with between 10,000 and 50,000 cases reported each year, a figure that is probably far from the reality. Ciguatera poisoning (CTXs) is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Pacific and Caribbean (West Indies). Ciguatera is a complex syndrome with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular effects. The symptoms appear two to twelve hours after the contaminating meal. The question of a possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain.",False,2022-07-21T00:00:00,2026-02-18T06:37:26,1.0,11,[2699]
227,1,F-2023-010,Irrigation with wastewater,"As climatic changes are increasing the pressure on water resources and more fresh fruits and vegetables are needed to meet the demands of a growing population, growers may need to start depending on more varied sources of water for irrigation, including environmental, recycled, and reclaimed wastewaters. Additionally, the wastewater draining from massive pools of sewage sludge has the potential to play a role in more sustainable agriculture (Science of The Total Environment, 20.01.2023). However, this practice is not without risks as some of some of these wastewater sources might be susceptible to contamination with microbial pathogensFor instance, surveys have found <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> in water, soil, vegetation, and farm animal feces around the world. The frequency at which this pathogen is present in water sources is dependent on multiple factors, including the season, surrounding land use, presence of animals, and physicochemical water parameters. Understanding the survival duration of <em>L. monocytogenes </em>in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors. Understanding the pathogen’s ability to remain infectious is key to understanding how <em>L. monocytogenes</em> impacts produce outbreaks and, ultimately, consumers’ health.Moreover, the German federal institute for risk assessment (BfR) has published a risk assessment of transmission of <em>Cryptosporidium </em>spp., <em>Giardia duodenalis</em> and <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>to humans related to using reclaimed wastewater in agriculture where they recommend to only use irrigation water of a quality comparable to drinking water for watering plants that are usually consumed raw.",True,2023-02-28T11:35:21,2025-07-24T07:08:52,1.0,32,[2704]
