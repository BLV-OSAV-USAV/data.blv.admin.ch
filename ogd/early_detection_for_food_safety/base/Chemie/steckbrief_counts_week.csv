8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53,[2232]
227,1,F-2023-010,Irrigation with wastewater,"As climatic changes are increasing the pressure on water resources and more fresh fruits and vegetables are needed to meet the demands of a growing population, growers may need to start depending on more varied sources of water for irrigation, including environmental, recycled, and reclaimed wastewaters. Additionally, the wastewater draining from massive pools of sewage sludge has the potential to play a role in more sustainable agriculture (Science of The Total Environment, 20.01.2023). However, this practice is not without risks as some of some of these wastewater sources might be susceptible to contamination with microbial pathogensFor instance, surveys have found Listeria monocytogenes in water, soil, vegetation, and farm animal feces around the world. The frequency at which this pathogen is present in water sources is dependent on multiple factors, including the season, surrounding land use, presence of animals, and physicochemical water parameters. Understanding the survival duration of L. monocytogenes in specific water sources is important, but studies are limited concerning this environment and the impact of these highly variable factors. Understanding the pathogen’s ability to remain infectious is key to understanding how L. monocytogenes impacts produce outbreaks and, ultimately, consumers’ health.Moreover, the German federal institute for risk assessment (BfR) has published a risk assessment of transmission of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Toxoplasma gondii to humans related to using reclaimed wastewater in agriculture where they recommend to only use irrigation water of a quality comparable to drinking water for watering plants that are usually consumed raw.",True,2023-02-28T11:35:21,2025-06-20T07:16:55,1.0,30,[2243]
