8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-10-10T08:53:59,1.0,59,[2476]
222,1,F-2023-005,Protein supplements : effects of a (too) high protein diet,"""A high protein intake is great for losing weight, but it's also great for athletes."" With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more ""high protein"" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this ""high protein"" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the ""healthy"" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of ""if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt"".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite ""high protein"" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly. Â In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.",True,2023-01-27T13:00:59,2025-09-16T07:10:35,1.0,24,[2478]
