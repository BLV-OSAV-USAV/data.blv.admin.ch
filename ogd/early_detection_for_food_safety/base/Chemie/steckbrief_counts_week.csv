34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., <a href=""https://www.biomin.net/en/articles/biomin-world-mycotoxin-survey-report-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018</a>).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-12-23T07:35:47,1.0,61,[2682]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2026-01-19T07:21:22,1.0,50,[2682]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2026-02-06T06:31:48,1.0,67,[2685]
126,1,F-2021-273,"6PPD-Chinon - car tire abrasion, artificial turf","Exposure of coho salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to stormwater causes unexplained acute annual mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban streams to reproduce. Investigating this phenomenon, researchers identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a ubiquitous antioxidant found in tyre rubber worldwide. Retrospective analyses of representative U.S. West Coast road runoff and stormwater-influenced streams revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD quinone (&lt;0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unexpected risks of 6PPD antioxidants to this aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for residues derived from tyre rubber.",True,2021-03-01T00:00:00,2026-01-06T12:48:42,1.0,51,[2683]
188,1,F-2022-344,Trifluoroacetate (TFA) in water,"Trifluoroacetate (TFA) is a mobile and persistent substance that is primarily introduced into the water cycle through the degradation of various fluorochemicals and remains there for an unforeseeable period of time. There is already a high baseline load of TFA in many water bodies with some regional hotspots. This background paper presents current data and estimates on sources, input pathways, loads, impacts and measures on TFA. It gives an outlook on first activities and options to comprehensively minimise TFA inputs to the environment. Despite gaps in knowledge, it becomes clear that consistent regulation and an overarching minimisation strategy must be initiated in the short term.",False,2022-05-03T00:00:00,2025-07-24T07:51:40,1.0,9,[2681]
