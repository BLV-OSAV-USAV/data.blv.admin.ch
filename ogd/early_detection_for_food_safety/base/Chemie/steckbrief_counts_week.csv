34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-12-23T07:35:47,1.0,61.0,[2631]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2026-01-19T07:21:22,1.0,50.0,[2631]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.",True,2019-05-27T00:00:00,2026-01-08T08:03:47,1.0,114.0,[2639]
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,42.0,[2639]
87,1,F-2019-127,Cyanide in foods,"Bitter apricot kernels, flax seeds, and cassava contain cyanogenic glycosides in comparatively high concentrations as natural plant constituents. Cyanide is released by the enzyme ss-glucosidase, which is also contained in the plants, when they are eaten. After ingestion of a correspondingly high dose, cyanides can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy production.Bitter apricot kernels are of particular concern as they can lead to poisoning even in small amounts.The consumption of flax seeds is harmless to health if the common consumption recommendations of up to 15 g per meal are adhered to. According to the BfR (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices), there is no cyanide risk when eating marzipan and persipan.",False,2019-11-19T00:00:00,2022-09-01T15:36:30,1.0,3.0,[2636]
