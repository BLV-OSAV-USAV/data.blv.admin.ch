34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-07-10T06:38:46,1.0,56.0,[2306]
148,1,F-2021-296,Food supplements - Nootropics,"The category of performance-enhancing food supplements has undergone a significant change in the last ten years. For a long time, the market was dominated by products that were intended to increase athletic performance (e.g. through building muscle).In recent years, however, another market segment has established itself, that of so-called nootropics (substances with an effect on the central nervous system). These nutraceuticals (traditional/herbal remedies, food supplements, functional food) focus on increasing cognitive performance. Thus, physical and, above all, mental performance is to be increased by these products.",False,2021-06-21T00:00:00,2022-09-15T11:39:44,1.0,3.0,[2299]
