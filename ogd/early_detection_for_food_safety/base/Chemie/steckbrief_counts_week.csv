8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,2.0,52.0,[2037]
147,1,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,10.0,[2042]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-11-26T14:04:08,1.0,29.0,[2033]
