36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-09-08T13:38:04,1.0,47.0,[2573]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-11-12T07:00:52,1.0,64.0,[2573]
147,1,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,2.0,10.0,[2576]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2025-05-22T08:55:29,1.0,34.0,[2586]
