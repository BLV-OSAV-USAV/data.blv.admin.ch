8,2,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52.0,"[1991, 1992]"
125,1,F-2021-257,Melatonin for post-harvest treatment,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is known as a potential free radical. In a study by Li et al. (2021), the prolonged effect of the shelf life of white champignons was investigated. These had a significantly longer shelf life depending on the treatment. Melatonin also delays the leaf senescence of Chinese cabbage (Tan et al. 2020) or the yellowing of broccoli (Wu et al. 2021 or Miao et al. 2020). It is also employed in the ripening of fruit (such as tomatoes; Sun et al. 2020) or to increase the resistance of grapes (Gao et al. 2020). Melatonin is found in plant-based foods and in very small doses also in animal foods. The highest melatonin content is found in cranberries (up to 9,600 µg/100g dry weight). Other sources of melatonin are some types of mushrooms (saffron milk cap, common boletus, agaricus bisporus, chanterelle), some types of cereals (corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley), mustard seeds, dried tomatoes and peppers, and some types of wine (wikipedia).",True,2021-02-25T00:00:00,2025-02-13T08:18:59,1.0,20.0,[1993]
234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-11-26T14:04:08,1.0,29.0,[2003]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-01-29T10:53:26,1.0,49.0,[1998]
