86,2,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:04:04,1.0,66.0,"[1908, 1913]"
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.",True,2019-05-27T00:00:00,2025-01-15T09:19:25,1.0,109.0,[1897]
4,1,F-2018-020,Anthraquinone in foods,"The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) carried out an expert opinion on anthraquinone in food on behalf of bio Suisse. The study was published in February 2017. The reason for this was the finding that residues were detected in various organic and conventional products in recent years. Anthraquinone acts as a repellent against birds and was therefore previously used to dress seeds. It is therefore considered a pesticide. In the EU, however, its use has been forbidden for several years now because of health concerns. An analysis by the BNN (Bundesverband Naturkost Naturwaren), the Association of Organic Processors, Wholesalers and Retailers, of several thousand datasets showed that smoked products in particular have a significant increase in anthraquinone content and that there are no differences between organic and conventional products. The authors assume that drying or roasting processes promote the occurrence of anthraquinones. It is further assumed that drying and possibly smoking processes are the main contributors to anthraquinone residues. The EFSA concludes in its expert opinion on anthraquinone as an active substance in plant protection products that carcinogenic effects related to anthraquinone cannot be ruled out and that the risk potential in mammals cannot be explicitly determined. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the substance as a possible carcinogen for humans (""Group 2B"").",True,2018-05-23T00:00:00,2024-01-30T08:45:50,1.0,16.0,[1904]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52.0,[1895]
