234,3,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-11-26T14:04:08,1.33,29,"[2024, 2023, 2033]"
165,1,F-2022-316,Marine toxins: an emerging risk in Europe?,"Ciguatera is the most common form of marine biotoxin food poisoning in the world, with between 10,000 and 50,000 cases reported each year, a figure that is probably far from the reality. Ciguatera poisoning (CTXs) is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Pacific and Caribbean (West Indies). Ciguatera is a complex syndrome with gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular effects. The symptoms appear two to twelve hours after the contaminating meal. The question of a possible emergence of indigenous European cases is raised in view of the potential impact of climate change on the contamination of the food chain.",False,2022-07-21T00:00:00,2025-02-17T07:18:01,1.0,9,[2019]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,1.0,50,[2017]
75,1,F-2019-115,Cyanobacteria,"Cyanobacteria are microorganisms found mainly in eutrophic freshwaters, i.e. waters enriched with nutrients. While the impact of climate change has an impact on the spread of cyanobacteria, human activity, both urban and rural (fertiliser runoff, sewage, etc.) is also crucial. Cyanobacteria can release toxins some of which are very dangerous to humans. The main circumstances and routes of exposure to these toxins are ingestion of contaminated water, inhalation, or skin contact during recreational water activities (swimming, water sports). Consumption of fruits or vegetables irrigated with contaminated water or consumption of fish and shellfish can also be a source of exposure to cyanotoxins. The effects of cyanotoxins on human health are varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are most commonly reported, but eye or skin damage (irritation and rash), myalgia, liver and kidney damage are also often described. On the other hand, the involvement of these toxins in the development of chronic diseases, especially neurological diseases, remains the subject of scientific controversy.",True,2019-10-17T00:00:00,2025-02-27T08:27:27,2.0,25,[2026]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52,[2022]
