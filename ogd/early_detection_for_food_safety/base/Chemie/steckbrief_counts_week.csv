234,2,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2025-05-22T08:55:29,1.5,35.0,"[2605, 2602]"
126,1,F-2021-273,"6PPD-Chinon - car tire abrasion, artificial turf","Exposure of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States to stormwater causes unexplained acute annual mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban streams to reproduce. Investigating this phenomenon, researchers identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a ubiquitous antioxidant found in tyre rubber worldwide. Retrospective analyses of representative U.S. West Coast road runoff and stormwater-influenced streams revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD quinone (<0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unexpected risks of 6PPD antioxidants to this aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for residues derived from tyre rubber.",True,2021-03-01T00:00:00,2026-01-06T12:48:42,2.0,51.0,[2611]
