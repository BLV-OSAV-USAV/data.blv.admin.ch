35,1,F-2019-055,Nanoparticles in foods,"Nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the food industry to modulate various aspects of food. As a result, man-made nanoparticles are increasingly being used as functional ingredients in foods and beverages. They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed. One study shows how nanoparticles can positively influence bacteria of the digestive tract. They speak of ""probiotic nanoparticles"". Nanoparticles are also already being used in pharmacy, for example to precisely transport substances to where they are needed.",True,2019-10-18T00:00:00,2025-07-11T06:41:30,1.0,23,[2503]
49,1,F-2019-081,Pyrrolizidine alkaloids,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) are natural constituents that have been identified in more than 350 plant species worldwide and are suspected in more than 6,000. Plants produce them as defensive substances against predators. Of more than 660 known PAs and similar compounds, the 1,2-unsaturated PAs in particular have a potential to be harmful to health. They are therefore undesirable in feed and food. In food, PAs can occur above all in tea, honey, dried herbs and spices. Studies have shown that pollen products sold as food supplements (NEM) and used in apitherapy may also contain toxic PAs.",False,2019-10-28T00:00:00,2023-09-27T07:25:54,1.0,4,[2507]
