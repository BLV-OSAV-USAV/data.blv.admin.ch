234,1,F-2023-017,PFAS in water and soils,"During the last 20 years, guideline values for Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, surface waters, and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.",False,2023-03-15T08:32:44,2024-08-30T08:15:03,1.0,28,[1713]
196,1,F-2022-352,PFOS in meat,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (conjugate base perfluorooctanesulfonate) is an anthropogenic (man-made) fluorosurfactant, now regarded as a global pollutant. There is a major focus on PFOS hotspot contaminations in DK right now. During the spring and summer a site previously used for training fires and firefighting has been investigated. A field close to the site was used for grassing by cows owned by 20 families. Five cows each summer has been grassing there. PFOS is analysed in the meat at concentrations from 156 to 230 ng/g in four samples from four cows. Also grass was analyzed from the area up to 165 ng/g and water in the stream showed very high levels. The theory is that rainwater is running off in the direction of the field and the stream. So the cows have had the intake both from the water in the stream and from the grass. About 187 local consumers, that have eaten the meat through the years, have had the blood analyzed for PFOS. There are a big variation of PFOS in the blood. From 1,1 ng/ml up to 500 ng/ml. Doctors at the nearby hospital will follow the people who has high levels in the blood and try to help them. They will now try to use a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that is thought to increase the secretion of PFOS. 145 other areas around DK, where use of PFOS has been going on, will now be investigated.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-09-04T06:40:26,1.0,6,[1713]
