21,1,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2025-11-06T09:49:22,2.0,15,[2518]
136,1,F-2021-283,Asparagopsis taxiformis as a fodder,"Cows exhale the powerful greenhouse gas methane. One of the ways to limit methane emissions from cows is to feed them the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis. This seaweed contains high concentrations of bromoform, a substance that counteracts the formation of methane in the cow's rumen. Studies by Wageningen University & Research show that bromoform can get into the cow's milk and urine. Bromoform in its pure form is harmful to health. There are limits to the maximum amount of bromoform in drinking water, but no such limits for food.",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-08-26T14:56:34,1.0,5,[2525]
