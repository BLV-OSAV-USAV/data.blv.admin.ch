40,1,F-2019-060,Cronobacter sakazakii,"Cronobacter sakazakii is a motile, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The bacterium has so far been detected in domestic environments and food production sites, in clinical sample material such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood or sputum, as well as in food (e.g., cheese, meat and vegetables) and animals (e.g., rats and flies). The bacterium Cronobacter sakazakii can cause life-threatening infections, especially in newborns. A Europe-wide study led by AGES has determined how frequently infections with this pathogen occur. In the process, 77 human C. sakazakii isolates from sick people from eleven European countries, of which 36 isolates were from 2017 and 41 isolates from the years before 2017, were evaluated by AGES.",False,2019-03-12T00:00:00,2024-08-20T07:28:43,1.0,9.0,[1974]
