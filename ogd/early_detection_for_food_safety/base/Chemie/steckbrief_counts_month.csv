8,5,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53.0,"[2099, 2122, 2069, 2121, 2086]"

34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,1.0,50.0,[2090]

These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-04-02T07:52:27,1.0,60.0,[2075]
195,1,F-2022-351,Antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural soils,"Antibiotic resistance genes may be considered as environmental pollutants if anthropogenic emission and manipulations increase their prevalence above usually occurring background levels . The prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII and aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII, frequent marker genes in plant biotechnology conferring resistance to certain aminoglycosides, was determined by Woegerbauer et al. (2015) in Austrian soils from 100 maize and potato fields not yet exposed to but eligible for GMO crop cultivation . Total soil DNA extracts were analysed by nptII/nptIII-specific TaqMan real time PCR. Of all fields, 6% were positive for nptII (median: 150 copies/g soil; range: 31-856) and 85% for nptIII (1190 copies/g soil; 13-61600). The copy-number, deduced prevalence of nptIII carriers, was 14-fold higher compared to nptII. Of the cultivable kanamycin-resistant soil bacteria, 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 0-3.3%) were positive for nptIII, none for nptII (0-0.8%). The nptII-load of the studied soils was low rendering nptII a typical candidate for environmental pollution upon anthropogenic release into these ecosystems.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-01-11T06:39:19,1.0,12.0,[2118]
236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-03-24T09:34:49,1.0,17.0,[2118]
181,1,F-2022-337,Safety of probiotics,"The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).
