86,3,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:04:04,1.0,66.0,"[1908, 1913, 1927]"

Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.33,52.0,"[1931, 1895, 1921]"

With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,"[1925, 1927]"
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed.

211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,42.0,[1920]

Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A).

4,1,F-2018-020,Anthraquinone in foods,"The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) carried out an expert opinion on anthraquinone in food on behalf of bio Suisse. The study was published in February 2017. The reason for this was the finding that residues were detected in various organic and conventional products in recent years. Anthraquinone acts as a repellent against birds and was therefore previously used to dress seeds. It is therefore considered a pesticide. In the EU, however, its use has been forbidden for several years now because of health concerns. An analysis by the BNN (Bundesverband Naturkost Naturwaren), the Association of Organic Processors, Wholesalers and Retailers, of several thousand datasets showed that smoked products in particular have a significant increase in anthraquinone content and that there are no differences between organic and conventional products. The authors assume that drying or roasting processes promote the occurrence of anthraquinones. It is further assumed that drying and possibly smoking processes are the main contributors to anthraquinone residues. The EFSA concludes in its expert opinion on anthraquinone as an active substance in plant protection products that carcinogenic effects related to anthraquinone cannot be ruled out and that the risk potential in mammals cannot be explicitly determined. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the substance as a possible carcinogen for humans (""Group 2B"").",True,2018-05-23T00:00:00,2024-01-30T08:45:50,1.0,16.0,[1904]
222,1,F-2023-005,Protein supplements : effects of a (too) high protein diet,"""A high protein intake is great for losing weight, but it's also great for athletes."" With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more ""high protein"" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this ""high protein"" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the ""healthy"" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of ""if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt"".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite ""high protein"" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly.  In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.",True,2023-01-27T13:00:59,2024-07-29T06:48:44,1.0,18.0,[1917]

Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential.

12,1,F-2018-028,Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp.,"Infections with Aspergillus spp. show a high morbidity and mortality rate in risk groups. Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance. Studies have shown that resistant Aspergillus spp. are also resistant to medicinal azoles, emerging from fungicides.",True,2018-04-13T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:22:19,1.0,16.0,[1977]
