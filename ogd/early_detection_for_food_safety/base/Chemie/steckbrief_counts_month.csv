21,3,F-2019-039,Nanoplastics,"Nanoplastics, the smaller fraction than microplastics, appear to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in fish. It is therefore probably of greater human toxicological significance than microplastics.",False,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2025-11-06T09:49:22,1.33,15.0,"[2513, 2518, 2495]"
8,3,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-11-12T07:00:52,1.0,63.0,"[2533, 2490, 2495]"
136,1,F-2021-283,Asparagopsis taxiformis as a fodder,"Cows exhale the powerful greenhouse gas methane. One of the ways to limit methane emissions from cows is to feed them the seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis. This seaweed contains high concentrations of bromoform, a substance that counteracts the formation of methane in the cow's rumen. Studies by Wageningen University & Research show that bromoform can get into the cow's milk and urine. Bromoform in its pure form is harmful to health. There are limits to the maximum amount of bromoform in drinking water, but no such limits for food.",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-08-26T14:56:34,1.0,5.0,[2525]
35,1,F-2019-055,Nanoparticles in foods,"Nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the food industry to modulate various aspects of food. As a result, man-made nanoparticles are increasingly being used as functional ingredients in foods and beverages. They already serve a wide variety of purposes: they give chewing gum its white colour and keep instant coffee from clumping.As far as health concerns go, something is particularly questionable with regard to these substances: can the particles, due to their small size, penetrate barriers that are actually supposed to protect against intruders? An American study has shown that manganese oxide nanoparticles were able to penetrate the brain via the nose of test animals.Consumers are concerned about the possibly carcinogenic and in the long run harmful substances.On the other hand, the targeted use of nanoparticles for health promotion is being discussed. One study shows how nanoparticles can positively influence bacteria of the digestive tract. They speak of ""probiotic nanoparticles"". Nanoparticles are also already being used in pharmacy, for example to precisely transport substances to where they are needed.",True,2019-10-18T00:00:00,2025-07-11T06:41:30,1.0,23.0,[2503]
49,1,F-2019-081,Pyrrolizidine alkaloids,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) are natural constituents that have been identified in more than 350 plant species worldwide and are suspected in more than 6,000. Plants produce them as defensive substances against predators. Of more than 660 known PAs and similar compounds, the 1,2-unsaturated PAs in particular have a potential to be harmful to health. They are therefore undesirable in feed and food. In food, PAs can occur above all in tea, honey, dried herbs and spices. Studies have shown that pollen products sold as food supplements (NEM) and used in apitherapy may also contain toxic PAs.",False,2019-10-28T00:00:00,2023-09-27T07:25:54,1.0,4.0,[2507]
