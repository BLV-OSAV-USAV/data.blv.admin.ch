36,2,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-10-16T08:33:11,1.0,39.0,"[1673, 1715]"

Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-09-30T08:28:10,1.0,48.0,"[1740, 1701]"

There is a major focus on PFOS hotspot contaminations in DK right now. During the spring and summer a site previously used for training fires and firefighting has been investigated. A field close to the site was used for grassing by cows owned by 20 families. Five cows each summer has been grassing there. PFOS is analysed in the meat at concentrations from 156 to 230 ng/g in four samples from four cows. Also grass was analyzed from the area up to 165 ng/g and water in the stream showed very high levels. The theory is that rainwater is running off in the direction of the field and the stream. So the cows have had the intake both from the water in the stream and from the grass. About 187 local consumers, that have eaten the meat through the years, have had the blood analyzed for PFOS. There are a big variation of PFOS in the blood. From 1,1 ng/ml up to 500 ng/ml. Doctors at the nearby hospital will follow the people who has high levels in the blood and try to help them. They will now try to use a type of cholesterol-lowering medicine that is thought to increase the secretion of PFOS. 145 other areas around DK, where use of PFOS has been going on, will now be investigated.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-09-04T06:40:26,1.5,6.0,"[1725, 1713]"

Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-09-13T08:13:57,1.0,46.0,[1675]
93,1,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used. Hence, synthetic cannabinoids are likely to pose a new risk.",True,2021-07-19T00:00:00,2024-09-27T08:55:02,2.0,52.0,[1672]
139,1,F-2021-286,Extraintestinal E. coli from poultry flocks,"Escherichia coli is one of the most important bacterial species studied, commonly found as a commensal intestinal inhabitant of humans and various animals. However, E. coli also represents an extremely versatile and diverse pathogen capable of causing infections of the gastrointestinal tract, termed intestinal pathogenic E. coli, while others, termed extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), cause infections outside the gastrointestinal tract. ExPEC include the following different pathotypes based on the host and site of infection; uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which are responsible for urinary tract infections (UTI); avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) causing the most common disease, colibacillosis in poultry; septicaemia-associated E. coli (SEPEC) and neonatal meningitis-causing E. coli (NMEC) responsible for septicaemia and neonatal meningitis, respectively. ExPEC infections in humans are a significant cause of morbidity or mortality and are also mainly responsible for economic losses in poultry due to reduced production. Poultry could act as a source of extraintestinal infections such as urinary tract infections, meningitis, septicaemia in humans or systemic disease in animals and pose a significant threat to food safety and human and animal health.",False,2021-05-19T00:00:00,2022-09-19T10:02:50,1.0,4.0,[1718]

Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-10T08:54:23,1.0,62.0,[1715]

Due to the high prevalence of elevated triglycerides in the population, they can be prescribed frequently. It is worth noting that low-dose omega-3 fatty acids are available over the counter. Some clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. People with this disorder are five times more likely to have a stroke. Lombardi et al (2021) found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared to placebo, with an incidence rate of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.54; p<0.001).",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-09-12T11:03:19,1.0,4.0,[1727]
27,1,F-2019-047,Dietary supplements,"According to Menu CH, around 50% of Swiss people regularly consume food supplements containing vitamins, minerals, trace elements or other substances. The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed. Consumers do not necessarily consult a doctor or a poison control centre, and there is no nutrivigilance system in Switzerland.Legal framework Switzerland: Most important: General food law provisions on safety and protection against deception, VNem, Ordinance on Novel Food, certain plants and substances may not be used in food (VLpH and VZVM). No nutrivigilance system (unlike France), no notification legal framework EU: Largely non-harmonised. Certain countries have specific regulations (maximum quantities, plant lists), some notification, few countries with nutrivigilance systems.",True,2019-02-11T00:00:00,2024-06-11T07:55:09,1.0,18.0,[1737]
