The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt.

Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise.

On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products.

Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015).

Alternaria spp. also infest other vegetables, namely tomatoes. They produce mycotoxins, with the 'big 5', namely alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT), being particularly problematic. These toxins have been detected in cauliflower. Other toxins are known. No maximum levels have been set for these toxins in food across Europe. The problem is being addressed; the focus of interest so far has been on tomatoes [1,2,3]. The first symptoms of cauliflower infestation are the formation of small black dots on the surface of an inflorescence. The FSVO does not consider such an incipient infestation to be a health concern. It cannot be assumed that an incipient infestation (visible through individual black dots on the surface) is accompanied by a contamination of the entire inflorescence that is hazardous to health. However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested. The question arises as to how the infestation progresses in cabbage vegetables, whose tissue is relatively firm, and whether there is a correlation between visible symptoms and a potential health risk.

93,1,F-2021-133,"Cannabinoids CBD,CBG,CBN,Δ-8 THC in foods","Foods containing extracts of hemp or cannabinoids (such as CBD) represent the current trend in Switzerland (FSVO, leaflet). The product range containing CBD includes various product categories, which are mainly sold on the internet. CBD, unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is not subject to the Federal Act on Narcotics (BetmG, SR 812.121) because it has no similar psychoactive effect. However, cannabinoids and hemp extracts are essentially novel foods, which is why they cannot be added to food as one pleases. In the USA, for a long time, the FDA had classified CBD as GRAS ('generally recognised as safe'), i.e. as a food additive, the substance was deemed to be harmless. However, this classification has now been revised and the FDA warns of possible side effects, such as liver damage, interactions with other drugs, fatigue, diarrhea and mood swings. Cannabigerol (CBG) is - similar to CBD - a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in various cannabis species. It has a relaxing effect but does not cause drowsiness; instead, it has an energising effect. CBG is thought to have medicinal potential, for example as an anti-inflammatory or when treating pain and nausea. However, cannabinoid research has not progressed enough to support the definitive treatment potential of cannabinoids. The FOPH writes: ""Regarding the effects attributed to CBD, research is still in its infancy and it is quite impossible to confirm or deny its effects and its usefulness for clinical practice. In general, it remains to be said that its efficacy is claimed to be more promising than what has been proven, but CBD is likely to be effective for certain symptoms and disorders"".In its 2019 European Food Trends Report, the GDI states that the market for 'drinkables' and 'edibles' - foods and beverages containing cannabis - is booming. Other cannabinoids are entering the market, such as cannabigerol (CBG) . CBD is the hype of the decade - according to New Food 2020 - but with the market for cannabidiol oversaturated in the U.S., product companies will introduce other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), which are said to have functional benefits regarding sleep and appetite manipulation. According to Food News, the FDA is expected to voice its concerns about these 'cannabis-derived compounds'. However, it is still expected that they will be marketed. Inquiries about this have already reached the FSVO. Since CBD is currently becoming a trend product and is offered in various forms (as drops, as food ingredient, in cosmetics, etc.), it is quite possible that other cannabinoids such as CBG will also become popular in the future. In Ireland, poisoning in children has occured 1) after the consumption of sweets (Ir Med J Vol. 2021 Vol.114, No. 8 p446). It is also suspected that synthetic cannabinoids were used.

Consumption of fruits or vegetables irrigated with contaminated water or consumption of fish and shellfish can also be a source of exposure to cyanotoxins. The effects of cyanotoxins on human health are varied. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are most commonly reported, but eye or skin damage (irritation and rash), myalgia, liver and kidney damage are also often described.

85,1,F-2019-125,Nitrite in meat products,"The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat may be linked to colorectal cancer. The cause is said to be nitrite curing salt, which is added to many products to prevent the growth of food spoilage bacteria, especially Clostridium botulinum. Several studies have investigated this hypothesis but have come to different conclusions. A connection between high nitrite intake from meat products and an increased cancer risk can neither be clearly proven nor disproven. Moreover, it is not only the consumption of a food that plays a role in the development of the disease, but the interaction between all lifestyle habits such as diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette consumption, etc. Nitrite is not only absorbed through cured meat products, but is also formed as a degradation product of nitrate-containing foods in the body. These are mainly plant foods, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the supply of nitrogen to the plant. Examples of nitrate-containing foods are salads and vegetables such as rocket, spinach, kohlrabi, beetroot and radish. Furthermore, nitrate converted into nitrite can react with amines, amides or amino acids (present for example in the gastrointestinal tract or in the production of meat products) to form nitrosamines. Many nitrosamines are potent genotoxic carcinogens in laboratory animals and it is assumed that many nitrosamines are also human carcinogens.",True,2019-11-14T00:00:00,2025-07-28T07:25:50,1.0,48.0,[1810]
12,1,F-2018-028,Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp.,"Infections with Aspergillus spp. show a high morbidity and mortality rate in risk groups. Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance. Studies have shown that resistant Aspergillus spp. are also resistant to medicinal azoles, emerging from fungicides.",True,2018-04-13T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:22:19,1.0,16.0,[1977]

Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential.

4,1,F-2018-020,Anthraquinone in foods,"The Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) carried out an expert opinion on anthraquinone in food on behalf of bio Suisse. The study was published in February 2017. The reason for this was the finding that residues were detected in various organic and conventional products in recent years. Anthraquinone acts as a repellent against birds and was therefore previously used to dress seeds. It is therefore considered a pesticide. In the EU, however, its use has been forbidden for several years now because of health concerns. An analysis by the BNN (Bundesverband Naturkost Naturwaren), the Association of Organic Processors, Wholesalers and Retailers, of several thousand datasets showed that smoked products in particular have a significant increase in anthraquinone content and that there are no differences between organic and conventional products. The authors assume that drying or roasting processes promote the occurrence of anthraquinones. It is further assumed that drying and possibly smoking processes are the main contributors to anthraquinone residues. The EFSA concludes in its expert opinion on anthraquinone as an active substance in plant protection products that carcinogenic effects related to anthraquinone cannot be ruled out and that the risk potential in mammals cannot be explicitly determined. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the substance as a possible carcinogen for humans (""Group 2B"").",True,2018-05-23T00:00:00,2024-01-30T08:45:50,1.0,16.0,[1904]
180,1,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T10:59:16,1.0,30.0,[2004]

The concern here is that products are not necessarily pasteurised, especially as nuts can be contaminated by micro-organisms and/or pesticides. In many countries, nuts are harvested by hand and dried in the sun. Contamination can occur through insects, birds, rodents, but also through air and soil. Wet, humid conditions also pose a significant risk for the formation of aflatoxins.

250,1,F-2023-033,Dimethylated Thioarsenates in rice,"Arsenic (As) occurrence in rice is a serious human health threat. Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that “DMA”, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates that have similar or higher cytotoxicities than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.Since the publication of the 2009 EFSA opinion on arsenic in food new studies have become available on the toxic effects of organic arsenic. Furthermore it has become clear that dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) is formed from methyl arsenate due to the application of sulphate fertilisers, and that this substance could be more toxic than methylarsenate. It is therefore appropriate to update the hazard identification and characterisation of organic arsenic. On the basis of the available occurrence data for organic arsenic or literature information on organic arsenic in food, the exposure could be estimated in order to carry out an assessment for the risks for human health related to organic arsenic in food. In view of different properties of the methylated arsenic species, arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and arsenosugars, it is appropriate to assess the organic arsenic species in 2 separate opinions: an opinion on methylated arsenic species and an opinion on arsenobetaine, arsenolipids and the arsenosugars, which should also include any other possible organic arsenic species. After finalising the risk assessments on inorganic and organic arsenic, also the combined exposure to inorganic and organic arsenic should be assessed (source: Open EFSA (europa.eu))",False,2023-11-09T07:40:13,2024-01-23T07:04:35,1.0,9.0,[2180]

236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-10-09T09:07:44,1.0,20.0,[2118]
181,1,F-2022-337,Safety of probiotics,"The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).
