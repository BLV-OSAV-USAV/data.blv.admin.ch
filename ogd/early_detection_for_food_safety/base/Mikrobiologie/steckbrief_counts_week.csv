116,1,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-12-16T08:15:28,1.0,30.0,[2597]
33,1,F-2018-053,EHEC: continuous increase in lab reports,"In 2017, a total of 696 VTEC cases confirmed by laboratory diagnostics were reported to the FOPH (463 in the previous year). This is once again an increase of 50% compared to the previous year. The rate resulting from 8.2 new cases reported per 100,000 inhabitants is the highest rate since the obligation to report was introduced in 1999. As in the previous year, most cases were registered in the third quarter. The age group of children under 5 years continued to show the highest rate of 16.0 per 100,000 inhabitants reported and accounted for 10% of reported VTEC cases. (source: Zoonosis Report 2018). This increase was already discussed in 2015, and at that time, this was attributed to the spread of new diagnostic methods (FOPH, 2015). New investigations by Swiss TPH show that the increase in case numbers are partially due to new analytics, but not exclusively. A seperate investigation is underway and about to be completed. It concludes that there is a real increase.",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-05-31T07:40:14,1.0,24.0,[2599]
129,1,F-2021-276,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia albertii,"Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003. This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live. Interactions between raccoons and other animals, such as wild mice and wild boar, may also be possible (Hinenoya et al. 2020).",True,2021-04-09T00:00:00,2025-01-27T07:37:47,1.0,33.0,[2591]
