257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10525137/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study from Canada</a>, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/16/3033"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study</a> found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2025-06-20T13:48:16,1.0,34,[2684]
267,1,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of <strong>avian flu</strong> in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a <strong>case fatality</strong> rate of <strong>52%</strong>. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in <strong>cow's milk</strong> in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the <strong>consumption of pasteurized milk</strong> and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2026-02-02T06:31:04,1.0,82,[2678]
293,1,F-2025-010,Zoonotic potential of foodborne isolates of <em>Klebsiella</em><em> spp.</em>,"Human infections with <em data-start=""74"" data-end=""86"">Klebsiella</em> have so far been primarily associated with nosocomial infections. Numerous studies now show that <em data-start=""184"" data-end=""196"">Klebsiella</em> spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,1.0,6,[2674]
23,1,F-2019-043,<em>Escherichia coli</em> ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown <em>Escherichia coli</em> clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant <em>E. coli</em> lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 <em>E. coli</em> isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of <em>E. coli</em> from meat products and clinical cultures showed that <em>E. coli</em> ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27,[2680]
