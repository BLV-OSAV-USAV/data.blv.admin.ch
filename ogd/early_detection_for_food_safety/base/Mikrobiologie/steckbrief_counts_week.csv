116,2,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:04:42,1.5,27.0,"[2344, 2345]"
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2025-08-07T08:20:17,2.0,12.0,[2344]
