7,1,F-2018-023,Microbiological safety: convenience products (produce),"Convenience (ready-to-eat) products are very popular. These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production? Is it a question of cross-contamination in production, in households?",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-11-28T07:59:19,1.0,37,[2460]
58,1,F-2021-097,Food platforms and delivery services,"What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a packaging-free delivery service as soon as autumn 2019.",True,2021-06-29T00:00:00,2025-07-25T07:10:30,1.0,13,[2449]
43,1,F-2019-063,Hepatitis E virus (HEV),"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important human infection in the EU/EEA countries and, according to EFSA, more than 21,000 acute clinical cases with 28 deaths have been reported in the last 10 years, with a tenfold increase in the total number of HEV cases reported; the majority (80%) of cases were reported in France, Germany and the UK. However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy. HEV can also enter food through faecal contamination. Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been identified in immunocompetent individuals as well as in recognised risk groups, such as those with pre-existing liver damage, immunosuppressive diseases or immunosuppressive treatments.",True,2019-05-10T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:32:58,1.0,36,[2451]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,1.0,22,[2451]
