293,1,F-2025-010,Zoonotic potential of foodborne isolates of Klebsiella spp.,"Human infections with Klebsiella have so far been primarily associated with nosocomial infections. Numerous studies now show that Klebsiella spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,1.0,6,[2629]
