157,1,F-2021-306,Toxoplasma gondii in ostrich meat,"Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide disease that affects humans and many animal species, including birds. Antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii have been detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. With the exception of a study from Spain, there is no information on the seroprevalence of T. gondii in ostriches from Europe. The aim of the study by Bàrtovà et al. (2021) was therefore to detect antibodies against T. gondii in farmed ostriches in the Czech Republic. Serum samples from 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus) collected from 9 farms were analysed by latex agglutination test. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 149 (36 %) animals. High seropositivity may, according to Bàrtovà et al., indicate a risk of infection from ostrich meat to humans. Brain and heart tissues appear to be suitable samples for PCR detection of T. gondii DNA. Ostriches can presumably react as serological non-responders to T. gondii infection. Bàrtov et al. suggest that ostriches may pose a high risk of toxoplasmosis to humans by consuming raw or inadequately cooked ostrich meat and that even seronegative ostriches may harbour T. gondii in their tissues.",False,2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-10-19T08:26:01,1.0,4,[2006]
178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-01-06T14:34:54,1.0,23,[2006]
238,1,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-02-18T07:03:45,1.0,55,[1999]
