238,1,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-09-08T11:00:27,1.0,67.0,[2430]
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-08-19T08:51:20,1.0,42.0,[2411]
116,1,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-09-18T07:52:29,1.0,28.0,[2429]
118,1,F-2020-236,Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4h - hypervirulent,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that comprises 14 serotypes, of which serovar 4h is a novel serotype recently reported. Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.",False,2020-12-22T00:00:00,2022-09-12T16:08:04,1.0,4.0,[2422]
293,1,F-2025-010,Zoonotic potential of foodborne isolates of Klebsiella spp.,"Human infections with Klebsiella have so far been primarily associated with nosocomial infections. Numerous studies now show that Klebsiella spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,2.0,6.0,[2412]
285,1,F-2025-002,Blastocystis spp.,"Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in human  faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with  the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.  Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study  showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity  of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of  asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without  symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,  weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections  can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even  though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immunosuppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.Contaminated water sources can lead to outbreaks of parasitic infections like Blastocystis sp., significantly straining healthcare systems and impacting community health. A systematic review analyzed 24 studies with 2,451 water samples from 15 countries, finding an overall prevalence of 18.8% for Blastocystis sp., with the highest infection rate in wastewater (35.5%) and notable levels in tap water (19.1%).",True,2025-02-03T16:15:44,2025-08-08T08:15:21,1.0,18.0,[2421]
