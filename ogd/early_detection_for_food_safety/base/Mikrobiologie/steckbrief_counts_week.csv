257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another study found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2024-09-30T09:20:31,1.0,24,[1853]
121,1,F-2021-239,Campylobacter lanienae at the slaughterhouse,"Foodborne campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of human bacterial enteritis in Germany. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main causative agents for enteric disease, but a number of other species are involved, including rare ones. These rare Campylobacter spp. are emerging zoonotic pathogens in humans due to increasing international movement of supplies, livestock and people. Campylobacter lanienae was first isolated from healthy slaughterhouse workers in Switzerland and at first its pathogenic potential for humans was considered to be low. Recently, the first case of Campylobacter lanienae -associated human enteritis was reported in Canada. Here, we describe a case of mild Campylobacter lanienae -associated enteritis with subsequent asymptomatic excretion in a butcher. The isolate is available at the TLV strain collection (no. TP00333/18). This first reported case of human Campylobacter lanienae campylobacteriosis in Germany demonstrates the agent’s likely zoonotic pathogenicity.",False,2021-01-31T00:00:00,2024-02-14T08:25:03,1.0,6,[1851]
31,1,F-2019-051,Campylobacter - roles of flies in transmission,"Campylobateriosis is the most common food-associated disease, not only in Switzerland but worldwide. The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis. When temperatures rise, the number of flies increases and the incidence of campylobacteriosis rises at the same rate.",False,2019-02-25T00:00:00,2023-10-26T07:35:31,1.0,5,[1851]
