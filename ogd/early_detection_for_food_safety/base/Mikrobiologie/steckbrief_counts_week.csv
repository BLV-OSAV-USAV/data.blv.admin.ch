263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,7.0,[2309]
23,1,F-2019-043,Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,2.0,27.0,[2314]
10,1,F-2018-026,Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in flour,"STEC from different types of flour have caused epidemics in CAN (O121) and the USA (O121, O26). Several  product recalls were issued in the USA. Based on the publication by MÃ¤de et al. (2017), investigations were also carried out at the FSVO which confirmed the findings (detection of STEC in types of flour).",True,2018-04-13T00:00:00,2024-01-19T07:25:05,2.0,18.0,[2314]
199,1,F-2022-355,STEC contamination in pork production chain,"Epidemiological evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections associated with the consumption of contaminated pork highlight the need for increased awareness of STEC as an emerging pathogen in the pork supply chain. The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets. In retail pork, serogroup O26 was prevalent in the U.S., Europe, and Africa. Serogroup O121 was only reported in the U.S. Furthermore, serogroup O91 was reported in the U.S., Asia, and South American retail pork samples. The most common virulence gene combination in retail pork around the globe were as follows: the U.S.: serogroup O157 + stx, non-O157 + stx, unknown serogroups+stx + eae; Europe: unknown serogroups +(stx+ eae, stx2 + eae, or stx1 + stx2 + eae); Asia: O157 + stx1 + stx2 + ehxA, Unknown+stx1 + eaeA + ehxA, or only eae; Africa: O157 + stx2 + eae + ehxA. STEC strains derived from retail pork in the U.S. fall under low to moderate risk categories capable of causing human disease, thus indicating the need for adequate cooking and prevention of cross contamination to minimize infection risk in humans.",False,2022-07-13T00:00:00,2024-07-01T10:36:13,2.0,9.0,[2318]
