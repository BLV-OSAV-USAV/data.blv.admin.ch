40,1,F-2019-060,Cronobacter sakazakii,"Cronobacter sakazakii is a motile, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The bacterium has so far been detected in domestic environments and food production sites, in clinical sample material such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood or sputum, as well as in food (e.g., cheese, meat and vegetables) and animals (e.g., rats and flies). The bacterium Cronobacter sakazakii can cause life-threatening infections, especially in newborns. A Europe-wide study led by AGES has determined how frequently infections with this pathogen occur. In the process, 77 human C. sakazakii isolates from sick people from eleven European countries, of which 36 isolates were from 2017 and 41 isolates from the years before 2017, were evaluated by AGES.",False,2019-03-12T00:00:00,2024-08-20T07:28:43,1.0,9.0,[1974]
12,1,F-2018-028,Azole resistance in Aspergillus spp.,"Infections with Aspergillus spp. show a high morbidity and mortality rate in risk groups. Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus. Another risk is the emergence of cross-resistance. Studies have shown that resistant Aspergillus spp. are also resistant to medicinal azoles, emerging from fungicides.",True,2018-04-13T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:22:19,1.0,16.0,[1977]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,[1968]
