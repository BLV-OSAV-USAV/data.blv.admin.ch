116,2,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:04:42,1.5,27.0,"[2344, 2345]"
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2025-08-07T08:20:17,2.0,12.0,[2344]
11,1,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.",True,2018-12-20T00:00:00,2025-08-04T06:53:33,1.0,49.0,[2341]
125,1,F-2021-257,Melatonin for pre- and post-harvest treatment,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is known as a potential free radical. In a study by Li et al. (2021), the prolonged effect of the shelf life of white champignons was investigated. These had a significantly longer shelf life depending on the treatment. Melatonin also delays the leaf senescence of Chinese cabbage (Tan et al. 2020) or the yellowing of broccoli (Wu et al. 2021 or Miao et al. 2020). It is also employed in the ripening of fruit (such as tomatoes; Sun et al. 2020) or to increase the resistance of grapes (Gao et al. 2020). Melatonin is found in plant-based foods and in very small doses also in animal foods. The highest melatonin content is found in cranberries (up to 9,600 µg/100g dry weight). Other sources of melatonin are some types of mushrooms (saffron milk cap, common boletus, agaricus bisporus, chanterelle), some types of cereals (corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley), mustard seeds, dried tomatoes and peppers, and some types of wine (wikipedia).",True,2021-02-25T00:00:00,2025-08-07T07:57:23,1.0,25.0,[2342]
