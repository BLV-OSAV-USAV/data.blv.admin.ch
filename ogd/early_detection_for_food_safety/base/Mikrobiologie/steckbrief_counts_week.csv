34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-06-20T11:27:24,1.0,54,[2222]
73,1,F-2019-112,Aeromonas spp.,"Aeromonas spp., such as A. hydrophila, are bacteria that can form cell-damaging toxins. They are widespread in nature and are found mainly in surface waters (lakes, rivers), hence the term 'water germs'. The bacteria have been detected in fish, but also in insects and domestic and farm animals, and can cause gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans. A. hydrophila is already known to be a pathogen in fish and seafood; the germ can also be detected in the meat of livestock, in vegetables and dairy products.",False,2019-10-18T00:00:00,2024-10-14T08:48:40,2.0,6,[2221]
