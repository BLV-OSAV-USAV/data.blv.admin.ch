1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,1.0,22,[2534]
178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-07-28T07:15:51,2.0,30,[2538]
