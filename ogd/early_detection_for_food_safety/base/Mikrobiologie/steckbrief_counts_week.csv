267,1,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of <strong>avian flu</strong> in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a <strong>case fatality</strong> rate of <strong>52%</strong>. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in <strong>cow's milk</strong> in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the <strong>consumption of pasteurized milk</strong> and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2026-02-02T06:31:04,1.0,82,[2668]
