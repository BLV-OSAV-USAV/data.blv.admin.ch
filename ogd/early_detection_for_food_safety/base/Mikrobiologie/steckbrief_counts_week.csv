11,1,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline. HorizonScan: Since 1999, 250 reports of Vibrio spp. in shrimp have been recorded.",True,2018-12-20T00:00:00,2024-10-28T07:44:02,1.0,45,[1777]
282,1,F-2024-030,Foodborne illnesses caused by Edwardsiella tarda,"Edwardsiella (E.) tarda is a bacterial pathogen with a wide host range in fish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. As a fish pathogen, E. tarda has a high economic impact. Foodborne diseases caused by the consumption of contaminated fish and seafood have been described in the past, particularly in Asian countries. There are first indications that the number of human cases of E. tarda infection is increasing and that cases are also occurring outside Asia. Climate change, environmental pollution and an increase in aquaculture are being discussed as possible triggers for the increase and spread. This BeoWarn report summarises current knowledge about the pathogen E. tarda as a possible cause of foodborne diseases.",False,2024-10-28T07:07:57,2024-10-28T11:40:20,1.0,6,[1763]
