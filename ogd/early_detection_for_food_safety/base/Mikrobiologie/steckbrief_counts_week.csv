178,1,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-01-06T14:34:54,1.0,24.0,[2046]
263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,4.0,[2036]
115,1,F-2021-231,Salmonella Napoli - seasonality,"Individual cases salmonellosis, spread throughout Switzerland and attributable to a specific salmonella species, were frequent in 2019. However, the occurrence of S. Napoli is particularly striking. The cases that have been occurring since 2002 show a seasonal pattern. The weekly threshold defined by the FOPH was exceeded in 2019, triggering investigations which, however, did not reveal any indication of a possible cause of the illness mentioned above. At present, there are no indications of sources or causes of infection. According to literature studies, the pathogen occurs conspicuously often on rocket. However, further investigations also show an association with surface water. Water could thus be a central source, whether as irrigation water for salads and vegetables or as water associated with leisure activities (bathing, swimming, paddling, etc.). Animal products, on the other hand, seem to be of secondary importance. In contrast to other Salmonella serovars, this pathogen seems to cause more invasive diseases in addition to gastrointestinal diseases.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2024-02-26T11:08:34,1.0,34.0,[2036]
285,1,F-2025-002,Blastocystis spp.,"Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in human  faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with  the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.  Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study  showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity  of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of  asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without  symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,  weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections  can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even  though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immunosuppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.Contaminated water sources can lead to outbreaks of parasitic infections like Blastocystis sp., significantly straining healthcare systems and impacting community health. A systematic review analyzed 24 studies with 2,451 water samples from 15 countries, finding an overall prevalence of 18.8% for Blastocystis sp., with the highest infection rate in wastewater (35.5%) and notable levels in tap water (19.1%).",False,2025-02-03T16:15:44,2025-03-03T16:53:14,2.0,8.0,[2044]
257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a study from Canada, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another study found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2025-03-07T08:45:21,1.0,28.0,[2039]
