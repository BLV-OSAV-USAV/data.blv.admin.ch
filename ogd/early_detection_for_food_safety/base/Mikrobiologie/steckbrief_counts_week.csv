116,1,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-12-16T08:15:28,1.0,30.0,[2597]
33,1,F-2018-053,EHEC: continuous increase in lab reports,"In 2017, a total of 696 VTEC cases confirmed by laboratory diagnostics were reported to the FOPH (463 in the previous year). This is once again an increase of 50% compared to the previous year. The rate resulting from 8.2 new cases reported per 100,000 inhabitants is the highest rate since the obligation to report was introduced in 1999. As in the previous year, most cases were registered in the third quarter. The age group of children under 5 years continued to show the highest rate of 16.0 per 100,000 inhabitants reported and accounted for 10% of reported VTEC cases. (source: Zoonosis Report 2018). This increase was already discussed in 2015, and at that time, this was attributed to the spread of new diagnostic methods (FOPH, 2015). New investigations by Swiss TPH show that the increase in case numbers are partially due to new analytics, but not exclusively. A seperate investigation is underway and about to be completed. It concludes that there is a real increase.",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-05-31T07:40:14,1.0,24.0,[2599]
