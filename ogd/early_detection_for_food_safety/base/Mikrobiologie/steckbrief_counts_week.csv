267,2,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a case fatality rate of 52%. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in cow's milk in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the consumption of pasteurized milk and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2025-11-13T15:16:14,1.5,77,"[2564, 2566]"
