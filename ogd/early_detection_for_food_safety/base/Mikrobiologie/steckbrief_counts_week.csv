42,1,F-2019-062,Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis,"In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.",True,2019-07-11T00:00:00,2025-10-09T07:44:35,1.0,52,[2472]
160,1,F-2021-309,Human milk donation and associated health risks,"In the absence of a lactarium in French-speaking Switzerland, young mothers give, sell, buy, or receive breast milk. There are platforms for these exchanges on social networks, but they do not seem to be supervised by health professionals. The journalist in this article raises the microbiological and toxicological risks that the failure to respect certain basic sanitary rules (use of medication and bacterial contamination by Salmonella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus) may represent for breast milk and therefore for the newborn. In 2022, a first lactarium will be opened, it is possible that these platforms will or will not cease to exist, but the question concerning the professional supervision of this issue remains if they continue to exist.",False,2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-01-13T15:13:17,1.0,8,[2468]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-09-24T06:44:21,1.0,60,[2474]
