60,1,F-2019-099,Pet food as a vector for pathogen transmission into domestic environments,"Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) <em>Salmonella </em>serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with <em>Salmonella </em>are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).",True,2019-08-05T00:00:00,2026-02-12T07:48:47,2.0,21,[2693]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2026-02-06T06:31:48,1.0,67,[2698]
