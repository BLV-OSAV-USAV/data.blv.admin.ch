24,1,F-2019-044,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE, syn. FSME)","TBE or tick-borne encephalitis (encephalitis = inflammation of the brain) is an infectious disease caused by the TBE virus. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick (Castor bean tick). This is the most significant way of transmitting the virus. An alimentary transmission by unpasteurised milk, or milk products from acutely infected goats or cattle was reported on and has been discussed repeatedly in the past. In Germany, two outbreaks, caused by alimentary transmissions, were detected in 2016 and 2017 respectively. TBE is a viral infection caused by one in three tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis).",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-10-09T09:56:29,1.0,37.0,[1711]
