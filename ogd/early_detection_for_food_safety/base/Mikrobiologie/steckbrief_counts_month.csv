232,2,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-08-19T08:51:20,1.0,42.0,"[2488, 2446]"

There are platforms for these exchanges on social networks, but they do not seem to be supervised by health professionals. The journalist in this article raises the microbiological and toxicological risks that the failure to respect certain basic sanitary rules (use of medication and bacterial contamination by Salmonella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus) may represent for breast milk and therefore for the newborn. In 2022, a first lactarium will be opened, it is possible that these platforms will or will not cease to exist, but the question concerning the professional supervision of this issue remains if they continue to exist.",False,2021-08-10T00:00:00,2023-01-13T15:13:17,1.0,8.0,[2468]
7,1,F-2018-023,Microbiological safety: convenience products (produce),"Convenience (ready-to-eat) products are very popular. These products include vegetables and fruits that are ready to eat or can be prepared with minimal effort (e.g. heating). Such products also find their way into smoothies, where a variety of different fruits and vegetables are processed. Numerous outbreaks involving such products have been reported internationally. The range of possible pathogens includes:

Viral pathogens: NoV on raspberries, cherry tomatoes; HAV on dates, frozen pomegranate seeds.
Bacterial pathogens: salmonella on melons, basil, coconuts; STEC on lettuce; listeria on pre-cut vegetables
Parasitic pathogens: cyclospora on pre-cut vegetables; crypotosporidia in smoothies.

For example, from 2015 to 2018, an outbreak related to frozen ready-to-eat vegetables was ongoing. The source of this outbreak could be identified. In addition to frozen maize, other frozen vegetables have also been affected. 47 cases and 9 deaths have been linked to the outbreak. As a result, there have been global recalls of frozen vegetables, with thousands of tonnes destroyed. In the UK alone, more than 50 products were affected. Recalls were also issued in Switzerland. It was striking that listeriosis was caused in frozen products that were not ready for consumption. The question arises as to what the reasons for the listerioses were. The question arises: how can listerioses develop from frozen products that are not ready to eat? Is this a question of inadequate heating instructions (e.g. microwave: too few watts, too short thermal exposure, no homogeneous heating) or a question of production? Is it a question of cross-contamination in production, in households?",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-11-28T07:59:19,1.0,37.0,[2460]

Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected. The list of outbreaks is long and seems to have been increasing in recent years.",True,2018-12-17T00:00:00,2025-02-28T07:42:44,2.0,20.0,[2465]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-10-22T07:57:49,1.0,60.0,[2462]

Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in cow's milk in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the consumption of pasteurized milk and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2025-10-09T08:35:31,2.0,72.0,[2484]
58,1,F-2021-097,Food platforms and delivery services,"What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a packaging-free delivery service as soon as autumn 2019.",True,2021-06-29T00:00:00,2025-07-25T07:10:30,1.0,13.0,[2449]
43,1,F-2019-063,Hepatitis E virus (HEV),"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important human infection in the EU/EEA countries and, according to EFSA, more than 21,000 acute clinical cases with 28 deaths have been reported in the last 10 years, with a tenfold increase in the total number of HEV cases reported; the majority (80%) of cases were reported in France, Germany and the UK. However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy. HEV can also enter food through faecal contamination. Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been identified in immunocompetent individuals as well as in recognised risk groups, such as those with pre-existing liver damage, immunosuppressive diseases or immunosuppressive treatments.",True,2019-05-10T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:32:58,2.0,36.0,[2451]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,2.0,22.0,[2451]
42,1,F-2019-062,Bacillus cereus sensu lato - Bacillus thuringiensis,"In agriculture, bacteria of the genus Bacillus are increasingly used as biocides or plant protection products respectively. B. thuringiensis in particular is used as an insecticide as these bacteria produce Bt toxins. The Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) consists of the B. cereus sensu stricto, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. cytotoxicus, and B. toyonensis species. B. cereus and B. thuringiensis genotypically hardly differ. Furthermore, in clinical diagnostics, these species are not differentiated; therefore, it is unclear to what extent B. thuringiensis could have an impact on food-associated intoxications. The greatest difference between the two species is limited to the presence or absence of plasmids. Plasmids often code exotoxins. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer would enable a plasmid exchange in the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Whether and how this happens has not been closely investigated yet. Thus, whether B. thuringiensis can be detected in food samples has also not been investigated in greater detail. Recently, certain strain of B. thuringiensis was described as being able to produce large amounts of sphingomyelinase; several other strains of B. thuringiensis demonstrated cytotoxicity in vero cell assays. Therefore, these strains have to be potentially considered virulent. The investigated strains were all isolated from biocides. The safety of strains (QPS or GRAS) employed in agriculture is not explicitly demonstrated. In general, precise identification and characterisation of the strains used, in particular of B. thuringiensis and of possible virulence factors, are not available.",True,2019-07-11T00:00:00,2025-10-09T07:44:35,1.0,52.0,[2472]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-09-08T13:38:04,1.0,45.0,[2464]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-09-24T06:44:21,1.0,60.0,[2474]
