36,3,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-05-26T06:47:48,1.33,44.0,"[2325, 2273, 2321]"

However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy.

Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,2.0,27.0,[2314]
181,1,F-2022-337,Safety of probiotics,"The microbiome affects the initiation and progression of cancerous tumours through direct effects on tumour cells, and indirectly through manipulation of the immune system. It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
Fungemia and other fungal infections have been associated with the use of probiotic supplements based on Saccharomyces boulardii (Rannikko et al., 2021).

11,1,F-2018-027,Vibrio spp. in seafood,"V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are marine bacterial microorganisms that can occur in seawater, especially at warmer temperatures. They are the main cause of bacterial diseases caused by seafood. These pathogens are regularly detected in the USA and Asia. In Europe, the pathogen is hardly ever found. There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures. Environmental and patient isolates show similar resistance profiles. These included resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and tetracycline.

236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-07-14T08:24:35,1.0,18.0,[2287]

The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets.
