257,2,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10525137/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study from Canada</a>, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products. Another <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/16/3033"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study</a> found that, on average, one in five seafood products sold at retail globally is contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales of clinical relevance.",True,2024-02-09T15:23:32,2025-06-20T13:48:16,1.0,34,"[2684, 2654]"
267,2,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of <strong>avian flu</strong> in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a <strong>case fatality</strong> rate of <strong>52%</strong>. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in <strong>cow's milk</strong> in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the <strong>consumption of pasteurized milk</strong> and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2026-02-02T06:31:04,1.0,82,"[2678, 2668]"
263,2,F-2024-011,"<em>Salmonella</em> Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","<em>Salmonella enterica</em> serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of <strong>antimicrobial resistance</strong>. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from <strong>poultry to humans</strong>, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,8,"[2650, 2640]"
101,1,F-2021-147,<em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>ST283 in fish,"<em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause various infectious diseases. Previously. the pathogen was mainly known to cause severe neonatal infections (e.g., neonatal sepsis), but now <em>S. agalactiae</em> has also been linked to food, specifically the consumption of raw fish. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of severe invasive infections in Singapore, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, which could be traced back to sequence type (ST)283 of<em> S. agalactiae.</em> Epidemiological investigations revealed that the consumption of raw freshwater fish (tilapia) was the trigger. Follow-up investigations used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the prevalence of the bacterium more precisely. The result:<em> S. agalactiae</em> ST283 seems to have caused diseases in humans and farmed fish in Southeast Asia for decades. However, much remains unclear. If ST283 is transmitted exclusively from fish to humans, as was the case in the Singapore outbreak, then cases of<em> S. agalactiae </em>sepsis in Thailand and Laos are predominantly a food-borne disease. However, whether the transmission is from aquaculture to humans or vice versa, and whether there is an as yet unidentified reservoir, remains unknown. The germ could also be detected in tilapia from Brazil. Until now, the serotypes ST260 and ST927 were known in Brazil, but now ST283 also seems to be widespread. Based on import data of live tilapia from Singapore in 2014, a study suspects that the genotype was introduced into the country by the imported fish.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2025-07-28T08:42:32,2.0,17,[2653]
60,1,F-2019-099,Pet food as a vector for pathogen transmission into domestic environments,"Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) <em>Salmonella </em>serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause. Petfood recalls due to contamination with <em>Salmonella </em>are also taking place in Europe (RASFF notification).",True,2019-08-05T00:00:00,2026-02-12T07:48:47,2.0,21,[2693]
23,1,F-2019-043,<em>Escherichia coli</em> ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown <em>Escherichia coli</em> clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant <em>E. coli</em> lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 <em>E. coli</em> isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of <em>E. coli</em> from meat products and clinical cultures showed that <em>E. coli</em> ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27,[2680]
