263,2,F-2024-011,"<em>Salmonella</em> Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","<em>Salmonella enterica</em> serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of <strong>antimicrobial resistance</strong>. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from <strong>poultry to humans</strong>, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,8,"[2650, 2640]"

Numerous studies now show that <em data-start=""184"" data-end=""196"">Klebsiella</em> spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,1.0,6,"[2674, 2629]"
101,1,F-2021-147,<em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>ST283 in fish,"<em>Streptococcus agalactiae</em> is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause various infectious diseases. Previously. the pathogen was mainly known to cause severe neonatal infections (e.g., neonatal sepsis), but now <em>S. agalactiae</em> has also been linked to food, specifically the consumption of raw fish. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of severe invasive infections in Singapore, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, which could be traced back to sequence type (ST)283 of<em> S. agalactiae.</em> Epidemiological investigations revealed that the consumption of raw freshwater fish (tilapia) was the trigger. Follow-up investigations used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the prevalence of the bacterium more precisely. The result:<em> S. agalactiae</em> ST283 seems to have caused diseases in humans and farmed fish in Southeast Asia for decades. However, much remains unclear. If ST283 is transmitted exclusively from fish to humans, as was the case in the Singapore outbreak, then cases of<em> S. agalactiae </em>sepsis in Thailand and Laos are predominantly a food-borne disease. However, whether the transmission is from aquaculture to humans or vice versa, and whether there is an as yet unidentified reservoir, remains unknown. The germ could also be detected in tilapia from Brazil. Until now, the serotypes ST260 and ST927 were known in Brazil, but now ST283 also seems to be widespread. Based on import data of live tilapia from Singapore in 2014, a study suspects that the genotype was introduced into the country by the imported fish.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2025-07-28T08:42:32,2.0,17,[2653]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., <a href=""https://www.biomin.net/en/articles/biomin-world-mycotoxin-survey-report-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018</a>).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-12-23T07:35:47,1.0,61,[2631]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2026-01-19T07:21:22,1.0,50,[2631]
257,1,F-2024-005,Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in raw seafood,"The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment.  The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. The unmonitored and excessive use of antibiotics in aquatic environments promotes the development and propagation of antimicrobial resistance, and fish can be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes, which can easily be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw fish, creating a public health problem.According to a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10525137/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study from Canada</a>, Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products.

51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources.

Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in <strong>cow's milk</strong> in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the <strong>consumption of pasteurized milk</strong> and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2026-02-02T06:31:04,1.0,82,[2668]
