239,1,F-2023-022,Helicobacter pylori in raw and ready-to-eat meat,"Helicobacter pylori, classified as a class-I carcinogen, is one of the leading medical pathogens of global concern associated mainly with the development of gastric adenocarcinomas and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas; nevertheless, its prevalence in food especially meat and meat products is not fully covered. A study investigated the prevalence, molecular characterization, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clarithromycin-, and metronidazole-resistant H. pylori isolated from raw and ready-to-eat meat samples retailed in Mansoura city, Egypt. The results showed a widespread contamination of examined raw and ready-to-eat meat product samples with multidrug-resistant H. pylori isolates, which could constitute a tremendous public health hazard.",True,2023-07-26T11:34:05,2025-03-24T08:10:39,1.0,35.0,[2149]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-02-28T06:47:20,2.0,51.0,[2157]
173,1,F-2021-325,Sapovirus - zoonotic agent,"Sapoviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They belong to the genus Sapoviruses within the family Caliciviridae. They infect people of all ages, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. The clinical symptoms of sapovirus gastroenteritis are indistinguishable from those caused by noroviruses, so laboratory diagnosis is essential to identify the causative agent. Sapovirus infections are a public health concern, causing acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide in both outbreaks and sporadic cases. Outbreaks often occur in semi-enclosed environments. Outbreaks due to food-borne transmission of sapoviruses have also been reported. Sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse. Currently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are widely used for the detection of sapoviruses from clinical samples because of their high sensitivity and broad reactivity and the lack of sensitive assays for antigen detection or cell culture systems for the detection of infectious viruses. Sapoviruses were first discovered in 1976 by electron microscopy in diarrhoeal samples from humans. To date, sapoviruses have also been detected in various animals: pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions and bats (Oka et al. 2015). Sapovirus is thought to be spread from person to person, through sewage infiltration into drinking water sources and via contaminated food. Among food-borne transmissions, seafood is a recognised source of sapovirus infection.",False,2021-11-10T00:00:00,2025-03-21T08:43:59,1.0,5.0,[2143]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,[2154]
