34,3,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-05-27T07:24:05,2.0,52.0,"[2157, 2176, 2186]"

With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-05-26T06:47:48,1.0,43.0,"[2183, 2154]"

138,1,F-2021-285,Brevetoxins - algal blooms,"Brevetoxins (Ptychodiscus toxins, PbTx) are neurotoxic algal toxins of the dinoflagellate species Karenia. The toxins are named after Karenia brevis. Karenia brevis is a marine alga and component of the phytoplankton of tropical regions and is regularly observed in the Caribbean and especially in the Gulf of Mexico. Here it occurs as one of the causative agents of ""red tides"", known as red algal blooms, which are formed by mass reproduction of these algae (Wikipedia). Other microalgae are also suspected of producing brevetoxins. This is the case with K. mikimotoi, K. bicuneiformis, Chattonella marina, C. antiqua, Heterosigma akashiwo and Fibrocapsa japonica. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that cause irritation of the mucous membranes and respiratory tract. The effect is similar to that of ciguatoxin, but those are less toxic. Brevetoxins were first detected in France in November 2018 in mussels in Corsica (117 μg/kg digestive gland). The associated water samples for phytoplankton monitoring showed the presence of Karenia spp. (a genus of microalgae, some species of which produce brevetoxins).",False,2021-10-28T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:43:40,1.0,3.0,[2164]
134,1,F-2021-281,Pheophorbides and other hazards in algae products,"Algae products with high levels of phophorbide (chlorophyll metabolite) have in the past (1970s) in Asia led to considerable health damage due to phototoxic effects in the consumers concerned. As a result, official limits were set for certain product groups in parts of Asia, but not so in the EU. It is therefore the responsibility of the food business operator to limit the content of pheophorbides in foods on the European market to a technologically unavoidable level in order to meet the requirements of European food law. The Japanese limit is 100 mg of pheophorbide present per 100 g, or 160 mg of cumulative pheophorbide (i.e. the amount of pheophorbide present plus the amount formed by chlorophyllase activity within a three-hour incubation at 37°C) per 100 g. In Taiwan, the limits only apply to dried seaweed with less than 7% residual moisture. They also do not apply to red and brown algae. According to the available literature, the minimum amount of pheophorbide that is photosensitising is 25 mg/day. Other chemical hazards - associated with algae - concern in particular iodine, cadmium, arsenic and lead, as well as microbiological hazards (see further documentation). Recent studies also show that red algae can be used in animal feed to reduce methane emissions from cattle stomachs. Chemical hazards from algae could find their way into the food chain via feed.",True,2021-06-30T00:00:00,2023-12-05T09:21:59,1.0,18.0,[2164]
202,1,F-2022-358,Ostreopsis - a new algae at European coasts,"In the summer of 2021, a new and unexpected phenomenon on the beaches of the Basque Country occured: a clinical picture reminiscent of an influenza-like syndrome, affecting entire families but also beach professionals (lifeguards, beach restaurant waiters, etc.). Water samples taken showed a high concentration of a microalga not visible to the naked eye called Ostreopsis. No serious cases were observed out of the 674 cases reported to the authorities in Bordeaux. Climate change and human activities are causing changes in the marine environment. It is in this context that new intoxications are appearing. These microalgae, invisible to the naked eye, grow on macroalgae and on the sea bed.They can also contaminate fish and shellfish through bioaccumulation.The particularity of Ostreopsis spp. is that it emits toxins in seawater and in particular at the level of the blooms. They are then aerosolised in the sea spray. One can therefore be intoxicated by the respiratory route without having set a foot into the water, through the skin when swimming, but also by ingestion when consuming contaminated products.

These microalgae produce toxins similar to palytoxin, responsible for :
Neurological signs: tingling, burning and headaches
ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and respiratory signs: runny nose, coughing, breathing difficulties,
Skin signs resembling urticaria,
Cardiac signs: tachycardia, high blood pressure,
Digestive signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
General signs: fever, muscle and joint pain.

Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,53.0,[2175]
173,1,F-2021-325,Sapovirus - zoonotic agent,"Sapoviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They belong to the genus Sapoviruses within the family Caliciviridae. They infect people of all ages, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. The clinical symptoms of sapovirus gastroenteritis are indistinguishable from those caused by noroviruses, so laboratory diagnosis is essential to identify the causative agent. Sapovirus infections are a public health concern, causing acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide in both outbreaks and sporadic cases. Outbreaks often occur in semi-enclosed environments. Outbreaks due to food-borne transmission of sapoviruses have also been reported. Sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse. Currently, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are widely used for the detection of sapoviruses from clinical samples because of their high sensitivity and broad reactivity and the lack of sensitive assays for antigen detection or cell culture systems for the detection of infectious viruses. Sapoviruses were first discovered in 1976 by electron microscopy in diarrhoeal samples from humans. To date, sapoviruses have also been detected in various animals: pigs, mink, dogs, sea lions and bats (Oka et al. 2015). Sapovirus is thought to be spread from person to person, through sewage infiltration into drinking water sources and via contaminated food.

The number of campylobaterioses is around 7,000 cases per year. The sum of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is estimated at over 1 million worldwide. With climate change, Canadian researchers predict that the incidence will double by 2080, due to an increase in fly populations that are likely to develop as a result of the warmer climate. Although the transmission of Campylobacter is not fully understood in all its details, domestic flies do not play a  insignificant role in the transmission of Campylobacter in reservoirs. Cousins et al. (2019) have investigated the role of flies in Campylobacteriosis.

However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy.
