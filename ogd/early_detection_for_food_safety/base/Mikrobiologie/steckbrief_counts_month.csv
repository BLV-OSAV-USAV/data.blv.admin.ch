36,2,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,"[1925, 1927]"
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed.

264,1,F-2024-012,Alternaria spp. mycotoxins in vegetables,"The plant disease cabbage blight in cabbage plants (Brassicaceae), e.g. cauliflower and broccoli, is caused by infestation with the fungal species Alternaria brassicae and A. brassicicola. Alternaria spp. also infest other vegetables, namely tomatoes. They produce mycotoxins, with the 'big 5', namely alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT), being particularly problematic. These toxins have been detected in cauliflower. Other toxins are known. No maximum levels have been set for these toxins in food across Europe. The problem is being addressed; the focus of interest so far has been on tomatoes [1,2,3]. The first symptoms of cauliflower infestation are the formation of small black dots on the surface of an inflorescence. The FSVO does not consider such an incipient infestation to be a health concern. It cannot be assumed that an incipient infestation (visible through individual black dots on the surface) is accompanied by a contamination of the entire inflorescence that is hazardous to health. However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested. The question arises as to how the infestation progresses in cabbage vegetables, whose tissue is relatively firm, and whether there is a correlation between visible symptoms and a potential health risk. Such findings could contribute to better consumer protection.",True,2024-04-08T14:10:35,2024-07-15T10:14:32,1.0,12.0,[1890]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2024-12-23T13:19:10,1.0,48.0,[1890]
108,1,F-2021-195,Residues of veterinary drugs in groundwater,"Due to the intensification of food production in Europe, veterinary medicines have become a critical component in animal husbandry. The administration of these products can potentially lead to their presence in environmental waters such as groundwater, which is why they are now considered potential groundwater contaminants. In Ireland, several residues of anthelmintic and anticoccidial veterinary drugs have been detected in groundwater. 22% of 106 sampling sites detected residues of anthelmintics in the range of 1-41 ng/L and anticoccidials in the range of 1-390 ng/L. Residues were higher near intensive farming sites. These veterinary drug compounds are associated with a range of acute as well as chronic side effects, and their degradation products may have additional adverse effects.",True,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2024-11-05T08:53:57,1.0,19.0,[1910]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-01-06T13:20:37,1.0,19.0,[1914]
8,1,F-2018-024,Microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in various bodies of water. It is estimated that 4.8-12.7 million tonnes of plastic entered the oceans in 2010. Plastic pollution is classified as an emerging risk and poses a global threat to marine ecosystems. Various studies (and subsequent media reports) report contamination of microplastics in table salt and drinking water. The amounts vary, but there is agreement that microplastics are found in table salt in different countries. Inorganic and organic particles can adhere to microplastics, which are then absorbed by the human body through consumption of contaminated salt. In addition, various types of plastic contain plasticisers, which can have a negative impact on health.",True,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2024-12-06T08:18:58,1.0,52.0,[1903]
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2024-10-15T12:53:55,1.0,41.0,[1929]

60,1,F-2019-099,"Pet food (Salmonella, Listeria)","Pet food, just like food for humans, can be contaminated by microbiological or chemical contaminants. This danger is exacerbated by the new food trend 'Barf' or 'Biologically Apporopriate Raw Food'. Barfing' involves feeding raw meat, offal, bones and ingredients such as fruit and vegetables. These are supposed to be good for the animal, but can be particularly contaminated with bacteria. Not only is there a risk of the animal becoming ill, but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. On the one hand, pet owners come into contact with the multi-resistant bacteria when preparing the food. On the other hand, pets have close contact with humans, which increases the risk of transmission from animal to human. Pet food for dogs has led to several outbreaks in humans. In the USA, for example, around 93 people in 27 states fell ill with various (multidrug-resistant) Salmonella serotypes in 2019 (4,[5],12:i:-, Infantis, Newport and London). Dried pig ears could be identified as the cause.

48,1,F-2019-078,Antimicrobial resistance in plant-based foods,"Antibiotics are essential drugs. They are used to treat diseases caused by bacteria. However, antibiotics increasingly lose their efficacy because bacteria are becoming resistant. In recent years, antibiotics have become less effective. In order to ensure their efficacy in the long run and to stem the spread of resistant bacteria, the Federal Council has adopted the comprehensive Strategy on Antibiotic Resistance (StAR), which is now being implemented in various fields. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens can also be found in foods. They can lead to increased resistance in humans. Resistance can be enhanced not only through animal products but also plant-based products. However, we have far less information on plant-based products than on animal food products. Salads are popular foods in a balanced and healthy diet. They are often sold in a ready-tp-eat packging (plastic wrapping). It is known that such fresh products can be contaminated with hygiene-relevant germs. Different research groups have shown that these products contain germs that are resistant to antibiotics.",True,2019-04-16T00:00:00,2024-10-01T16:49:39,2.0,34.0,[1883]
129,1,F-2021-276,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia albertii,"Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003. This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live. Interactions between raccoons and other animals, such as wild mice and wild boar, may also be possible (Hinenoya et al. 2020).",True,2021-04-09T00:00:00,2024-09-11T07:46:35,2.0,32.0,[1896]

CWD has been confirmed in at least 26 US states, three Canadian provinces, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The number of cases has been increasing for the past 5 years. US scientists assume a possible risk of infection for humans, by analogy with BSE. They conclude that the available data suggest that the incidence of CWD in cervids is increasing and that there is potential for transmission to humans and subsequent human disease. Given the long incubation period of prion-associated diseases, consideration should be given to improving public health measures to prevent human exposure to CWD prions and thus reduce the potential risk to humans.

86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:04:04,1.0,66.0,[1927]
