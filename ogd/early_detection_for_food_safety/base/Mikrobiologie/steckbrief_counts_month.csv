36,3,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,"[1925, 1927, 1968]"
199,3,F-2022-355,STEC contamination in pork production chain,"Epidemiological evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections associated with the consumption of contaminated pork highlight the need for increased awareness of STEC as an emerging pathogen in the pork supply chain. The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets.

There are fears that these pathogens will become increasingly important as the oceans warm up. The severity of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus can be described as very severe. According to literature, the lethality rate is over 50% after infection. This makes it one of the most serious pathogens in terms of lethality in the area of food-borne diseases. The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen. In addition, various publications report the multiple development of antibiotic resistance in these pathogens, caused by the use of antibiotics in aquacultures.

201,1,F-2022-357,Bacillus cytotoxicus,"Bacillus cytotoxicus is a member of the Bacillus cereus group. This group comprises closely related organisms of varying pathogenicity including the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus sensu stricto. Some members of the B. cereus group can cause two distinct forms of food-borne illness: Firstly, the diarrheal syndrome that is linked to three enterotoxins - Hbl, Nhe and CytK - and secondly, the emetic syndrome caused by cereulide toxin preformed in food. B. cytotoxicus was isolated for the first time in the context of a severe outbreak of diarrheal disease leading to fatalities and was described as a species in 2013. The organism harbors a specific variant of the gene encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin K designated cytK-1. It has been reported that the cytotoxin K variant CytK-1 confers substantially higher toxicity than CytK-2. B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and might be missed using routine diagnostic screening for B. cereus group organisms at 30°C. Targeted screening at temperatures of at least 37°C has shown that dried food matrices containing potato starch very commonly harbor B. cytotoxicus.For instance, a recent study found a prevalence of 95% in mashed potato powder sold at retail level in Switzerland. Recent reports from the UK suggest that B. cytotoxicus also occurs in association with insect-based foods, which have recently gained popularity. In cytotoxicity assays, the few B. cytotoxicus strains that have been characterized to date range from non-toxic to extremely toxic, with toxicity surpassing the toxicity of a B. cereus outbreak strain (NVH 0075-95) used as a reference. Information on B. cytotoxicus is still limited and it is unclear if the organism’s capacity to germinate, produce enterotoxins, and exhibit cytotoxic effects in the intestine is comparable to that of B. cereus.B. cytotoxicus is a Gram-positive, aerobic organism able to produce spores. The species description was based on five strains, four of which were linked to foodborne disease (Guinebretière et al., 2013). B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and able to grow at temperatures of up to 53°C. Further characteristic features are the absence of starch hydrolysis and the dependency from tryptophan for growth. B. cytotoxicus also characteristically harbors the cytK-1 variant of the cytotoxin K gene.",True,2022-07-18T00:00:00,2025-01-31T07:47:14,1.0,32.0,[1958]

Serum samples from 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus) collected from 9 farms were analysed by latex agglutination test. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 149 (36 %) animals. High seropositivity may, according to Bàrtovà et al., indicate a risk of infection from ostrich meat to humans. Brain and heart tissues appear to be suitable samples for PCR detection of T. gondii DNA. Ostriches can presumably react as serological non-responders to T. gondii infection.

The vast majority of these CFTIs occur in restaurants, school canteens or in the home. Staphylococci and ES are most often detected in food samples and more rarely in the vomit and stools of patients. Very often, only ES are detected in contaminated food; the bacterial strains producing these toxins have been eliminated by the preparation conditions. It is therefore sometimes difficult to link ES to the producing strains.

211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found.

Over 30 different species are responsible for this, but the species Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common. Azoles, mainly triazoles, are used to prevent or treat Aspergillus spp. infections in humans and plants. Resistance of Aspergillus usually results from long-term treatments with triazoles. However, A. fumigatus has been isolated from patients who have never been treated with such drugs. It is therefore suspected that resistant strains spread in the environment. These strains may have acquired their resistance through the use of triazole-based fungicides. Azole resistance is therefore described as an emerging problem. In Germany, an increased number of aspergilloses have been observed in the last 5 years. In agriculture, resistance to Aspergillus also seems to be increasing, probably due to changes in cultivation techniques (minimum tillage) which may promote contamination and the growth of Aspergillus.

This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live.
