23,1,F-2019-043,Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27.0,[2402]

58,1,F-2021-097,Food platforms and delivery services,"What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a packaging-free delivery service as soon as autumn 2019.",True,2021-06-29T00:00:00,2025-07-25T07:10:30,1.0,13.0,[2449]
116,1,F-2021-232,Anisakis spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with Anksakis spp., a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of Anisakis. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (J. Ivanović J. et al, 2017); indeed, some Anisakis allergens are heat-stable and resistant to pepsin (Morozińska-Gogol J. et al., 2019).",True,2021-01-05T00:00:00,2025-09-18T07:52:29,1.0,28.0,[2429]
43,1,F-2019-063,Hepatitis E virus (HEV),"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important human infection in the EU/EEA countries and, according to EFSA, more than 21,000 acute clinical cases with 28 deaths have been reported in the last 10 years, with a tenfold increase in the total number of HEV cases reported; the majority (80%) of cases were reported in France, Germany and the UK. However, as human infections are not notifiable in all Member States and surveillance varies from country to country, the number of reported cases is not comparable and the actual number of cases may be higher. Food-borne transmissions of HEV appear to be one of the main routes in Europe; pigs and wild boar are the main source of HEV, but deer may also be infected. There is a particular risk related to the consumption of pig liver and raw meat products. Recently, HEV has been detected in shellfish and their production environment (seawater) in Italy. HEV can also enter food through faecal contamination. Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been identified in immunocompetent individuals as well as in recognised risk groups, such as those with pre-existing liver damage, immunosuppressive diseases or immunosuppressive treatments.",True,2019-05-10T00:00:00,2025-08-08T08:32:58,1.0,36.0,[2451]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,1.0,22.0,[2451]
118,1,F-2020-236,Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4h - hypervirulent,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that comprises 14 serotypes, of which serovar 4h is a novel serotype recently reported. Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.",False,2020-12-22T00:00:00,2022-09-12T16:08:04,1.0,4.0,[2422]

Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in cow's milk in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the consumption of pasteurized milk and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2025-10-02T14:22:12,2.0,71.0,[2393]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-09-24T06:44:21,1.0,60.0,[2397]
285,1,F-2025-002,Blastocystis spp.,"Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in human  faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with  the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.  Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study  showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity  of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of  asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without  symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,  weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections  can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even  though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immunosuppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.Contaminated water sources can lead to outbreaks of parasitic infections like Blastocystis sp., significantly straining healthcare systems and impacting community health. A systematic review analyzed 24 studies with 2,451 water samples from 15 countries, finding an overall prevalence of 18.8% for Blastocystis sp., with the highest infection rate in wastewater (35.5%) and notable levels in tap water (19.1%).",True,2025-02-03T16:15:44,2025-08-08T08:15:21,1.0,18.0,[2421]
