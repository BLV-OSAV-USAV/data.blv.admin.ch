23,1,F-2019-043,Escherichia coli ST131 as a uropathogen,"In 2008, a previously unknown Escherichia coli clonal group, sequence type 131 (ST131), was identified on three continents. Today, ST131 is the predominant E. coli lineage among extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates worldwide. Retrospective studies have suggested that it may originally have risen to prominence as early as 2003. ST131 isolates are commonly reported to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, such as CTX-M-15, and almost all are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, ST131 E. coli isolates are considered to be truly pathogenic, due to the spectrum of infections they cause in both community and hospital settings, and the large number of virulence-associated genes they contain. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human exposure to ST131; recently in the United States, a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat products and clinical cultures showed that E. coli ST131 strains are shared by both clinical samples from extra-intestinal human infections and meat samples from poultry.",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2024-01-30T09:34:46,1.0,27.0,[2402]
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-08-19T08:51:20,1.0,42.0,[2411]
118,1,F-2020-236,Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4h - hypervirulent,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that comprises 14 serotypes, of which serovar 4h is a novel serotype recently reported. Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.",False,2020-12-22T00:00:00,2022-09-12T16:08:04,1.0,4.0,[2422]
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2025-09-08T13:38:04,3.0,45.0,[2383]
293,1,F-2025-010,Zoonotic potential of foodborne isolates of Klebsiella spp.,"Human infections with Klebsiella have so far been primarily associated with nosocomial infections. Numerous studies now show that Klebsiella spp. are also present in the food chain and in environmental samples. The pathogen has been isolated from food-producing animals and from food products such as milk, salads, and poultry. It is therefore suspected that foodborne infections also occur.",False,2025-08-11T10:03:25,2025-08-11T10:53:49,2.0,6.0,[2412]
267,1,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a case fatality rate of 52%. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in cow's milk in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the consumption of pasteurized milk and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2025-09-10T07:51:41,2.0,68.0,[2393]
34,1,F-2018-054,Mycotoxins in foods,"Mycotoxins are metabolites formed from certain moulds. Mould – and hence mycotoxins – can form on vulnerable foods in warm and humid conditions, either whilst crops are still growing or post-harvest during storage, drying and transport. Most mycotoxins have toxic effects in humans, and some of the better characterised mycotoxins have regulatory limits in food. Certain foods are at particular risk. These include nuts and peanuts (primarily for aflatoxins) and raisins (primarily for ochratoxin A). Horizon Scan (a non-public database) has compiled a list of the most important products and has noted an increase in recalls. These findings are also supported by other stakeholders across the food chain (e.g., Biomin World Mycotoxin Survey 2018).",True,2018-12-11T00:00:00,2025-09-16T16:13:15,1.0,59.0,[2397]
285,1,F-2025-002,Blastocystis spp.,"Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in human  faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with  the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.  Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study  showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity  of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of  asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without  symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,  weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections  can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even  though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immunosuppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.Contaminated water sources can lead to outbreaks of parasitic infections like Blastocystis sp., significantly straining healthcare systems and impacting community health. A systematic review analyzed 24 studies with 2,451 water samples from 15 countries, finding an overall prevalence of 18.8% for Blastocystis sp., with the highest infection rate in wastewater (35.5%) and notable levels in tap water (19.1%).",True,2025-02-03T16:15:44,2025-08-08T08:15:21,1.0,18.0,[2421]
