178,2,F-2022-334,Protozoan parasites in foods,"Parasitic protozoa are important pathogens in humans and animals. Due to their complex life cycles, different transmission routes and longer periods between infection and symptoms, the public health burden and the relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. There are about 40 known human pathogenic species. They include cryptosporidia, giardia, microsporidia, toxoplasma, balantidium coli, entamoeba histolytica, blastocystis. Cryptosporidia and Giardia are considered the main cause of diarrhoeal diseases in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmas, for example, were ranked as the pathogens with the highest risk in a comparative assessment by the Biological Hazards Panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment in 2021. In pets, coccidia, toxoplasma, cryptosporidia and giardia are the main ones. In addition to consumer exposure to protozoan parasites through animal contact or contaminated water, foodborne transmission is also possible.",True,2022-08-03T00:00:00,2025-11-24T15:15:20,1.5,38,"[2538, 2542]"
267,2,F-2024-015,Avian flu: WHO warns of a high concentration of the HPAI (H5N1) virus in milk from contaminated cows,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries between 2023 and April 1, 2024, with a case fatality rate of 52%. Traces of the H5N1 virus were found in cow's milk in the United States, prompting the WHO to recommend the consumption of pasteurized milk and to conduct studies on the virus's survival in milk. The virus has been found to spread to mammals, including cows and goats, and there has been a case of cow-to-human transmission in Texas. While human infections remain rare and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health officials are concerned about the potential for the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans.",False,2024-04-25T08:27:48,2025-11-13T15:16:14,1.5,77,"[2564, 2566]"
263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,8,[2570]
1,1,F-2018-006,Food-borne viruses,"Food-borne infections caused by various viruses are a burden to the national economy and public health. In surveys of experts in the field of risk assessment (Delphi methodology), food-associated viruses were assigned to the ten most important microbiological hazards by Rowe und Bolger (2016). The focus of virus-associated outbreaks has so far been on noroviruses (NV) and hepatitis A. In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish. It is more problematic with fresh fruit, such as berries and dates, where thermal treatment is not an option due to the product characteristics.",False,2018-09-25T00:00:00,2025-09-29T09:28:13,1.0,22,[2534]
