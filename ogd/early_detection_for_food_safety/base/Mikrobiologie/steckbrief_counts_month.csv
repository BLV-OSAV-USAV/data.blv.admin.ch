199,3,F-2022-355,STEC contamination in pork production chain,"Epidemiological evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections associated with the consumption of contaminated pork highlight the need for increased awareness of STEC as an emerging pathogen in the pork supply chain. The reported prevalence rate of stx-positive E. coli isolates in live swine, slaughtered swine, and retail pork samples around the world ranged from 4.4 % (22/500) to 68.3 % (82/120), 22 % (309/1395) to 86.3 % (69/80), and 0.10 % (1/1167) to 80 % (32/40), respectively,depending upon the sample categories, detection methods, and the hygiene condition of the slaughterhouses and retail markets.

Alternaria spp. also infest other vegetables, namely tomatoes. They produce mycotoxins, with the 'big 5', namely alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN) and altenuene (ALT), being particularly problematic. These toxins have been detected in cauliflower. Other toxins are known. No maximum levels have been set for these toxins in food across Europe. The problem is being addressed; the focus of interest so far has been on tomatoes [1,2,3]. The first symptoms of cauliflower infestation are the formation of small black dots on the surface of an inflorescence. The FSVO does not consider such an incipient infestation to be a health concern. It cannot be assumed that an incipient infestation (visible through individual black dots on the surface) is accompanied by a contamination of the entire inflorescence that is hazardous to health. However, the FSVO cannot make a recommendation regarding a decision (eat or reject) based on the first visible symptoms and applicable to the layperson. The spread of mycotoxins in infested vegetables depends on the water content of the vegetable tissue. The higher the water content (e.g. tomato vs. cabbage), the faster the spread. However, there are various indiscriminate recommendations to dispose of the product if it is visibly infested. The question arises as to how the infestation progresses in cabbage vegetables, whose tissue is relatively firm, and whether there is a correlation between visible symptoms and a potential health risk. Such findings could contribute to better consumer protection.",True,2024-04-08T14:10:35,2024-07-15T10:14:32,1.0,12.0,[1890]

This group comprises closely related organisms of varying pathogenicity including the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus sensu stricto. Some members of the B. cereus group can cause two distinct forms of food-borne illness: Firstly, the diarrheal syndrome that is linked to three enterotoxins - Hbl, Nhe and CytK - and secondly, the emetic syndrome caused by cereulide toxin preformed in food. B. cytotoxicus was isolated for the first time in the context of a severe outbreak of diarrheal disease leading to fatalities and was described as a species in 2013. The organism harbors a specific variant of the gene encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin K designated cytK-1. It has been reported that the cytotoxin K variant CytK-1 confers substantially higher toxicity than CytK-2. B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and might be missed using routine diagnostic screening for B. cereus group organisms at 30°C. Targeted screening at temperatures of at least 37°C has shown that dried food matrices containing potato starch very commonly harbor B. cytotoxicus.For instance, a recent study found a prevalence of 95% in mashed potato powder sold at retail level in Switzerland. Recent reports from the UK suggest that B. cytotoxicus also occurs in association with insect-based foods, which have recently gained popularity. In cytotoxicity assays, the few B. cytotoxicus strains that have been characterized to date range from non-toxic to extremely toxic, with toxicity surpassing the toxicity of a B. cereus outbreak strain (NVH 0075-95) used as a reference. Information on B. cytotoxicus is still limited and it is unclear if the organism’s capacity to germinate, produce enterotoxins, and exhibit cytotoxic effects in the intestine is comparable to that of B. cereus.B. cytotoxicus is a Gram-positive, aerobic organism able to produce spores. The species description was based on five strains, four of which were linked to foodborne disease (Guinebretière et al., 2013). B. cytotoxicus is thermotolerant and able to grow at temperatures of up to 53°C. Further characteristic features are the absence of starch hydrolysis and the dependency from tryptophan for growth. B. cytotoxicus also characteristically harbors the cytK-1 variant of the cytotoxin K gene.",True,2022-07-18T00:00:00,2025-01-31T07:47:14,1.0,32.0,[1958]

In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities. By means of thermal treatment, food-relevant viruses such as NV, HAV and HEV can be efficiently inactivated, even in complex foods such as shellfish.

The FDA regulation expresses this with a zero tolerance. In the EU and Switzerland, there is no regulation of this pathogen.

The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found.

This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples.
