In recent years, the importance of diseases with hepatitis E (HEV) has also increased, as a result of which Switzerland subsequently launched a reporting obligation for HEV diseases. Globally, NV is the most common cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Most outbreaks are due to contaminated leafy vegetables, fresh fruit and shellfish. Due to global trade, viruses from endemic areas are also expected to spread. Recent example: HAV outbreak in the EU associated with products from Morocco. The detection of viruses in food is a challenge because the isolation of viruses from complex food matrices is complex, the viruses are heterogeneously distributed and sometimes occur in minute quantities.

This newly described enteropathogen and avian pathogen is often misidentified as E. coli (Ooka et al., 2012) or other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae due to its poorly defined biochemical properties and general lack of clarity. Furthermore, E. albertii strongly resembles E. coli in its phenotypic characteristics. The presence of the major virulence factor intimin in E. albertii is well established, while little is known about the presence of Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. albertii (STEA). Stxs are the major virulence factors of Stx producing E. coli (STEC) in human infections. However, STEC strains that produce intimin, a host cell adhesin, often cause more critical symptoms in patients than STEC strains that do not produce intimin (Murakami et al., 2014). Several studies investigated the environmental prevalence, detection capabilities, genome and pathogenicity potential of STEA strains. STEA has been isolated from various animals, such as pigs, cats and birds, but the natural reservoir of E. albertii is still unclear; this information would be important to determine transmission dynamics and prevent E. albertii infections. Given that patients in clinical outbreaks in Japan may be infected by water (spring and well water) or vegetables, but not by meat, the natural reservoir of STEA may not be large food animals (e.g. cattle and chickens, the reservoirs for Shiga toxin producing E. coli and Campylobacter jejuni). Another possibility is wildlife, which can contaminate water and vegetables in the area. In the 2020 study from Japan, they detected STEA by PCR in 248 (57.7%) of 430 raccoons from Osaka, Japan, and isolated 143 STEA strains from the 62 PCR-positive samples. In addition to Japan, STEA has also been clinically isolated in other countries where raccoons live.

The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found.

It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).

They are often sold in a ready-tp-eat packging (plastic wrapping). It is known that such fresh products can be contaminated with hygiene-relevant germs.

236,3,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-07-14T08:24:35,1.0,18.0,"[1647, 2287, 2118]"

Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).",True,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2025-05-26T11:50:21,2.0,33.0,[1833]

As a result, official limits were set for certain product groups in parts of Asia, but not so in the EU. It is therefore the responsibility of the food business operator to limit the content of pheophorbides in foods on the European market to a technologically unavoidable level in order to meet the requirements of European food law. The Japanese limit is 100 mg of pheophorbide present per 100 g, or 160 mg of cumulative pheophorbide (i.e. the amount of pheophorbide present plus the amount formed by chlorophyllase activity within a three-hour incubation at 37°C) per 100 g. In Taiwan, the limits only apply to dried seaweed with less than 7% residual moisture. They also do not apply to red and brown algae. According to the available literature, the minimum amount of pheophorbide that is photosensitising is 25 mg/day. Other chemical hazards - associated with algae - concern in particular iodine, cadmium, arsenic and lead, as well as microbiological hazards (see further documentation).

Many of the fungal pathogens are resistant to treatment with current drugs – of which only four classes are in use – or can rapidly acquire resistance during treatment or in their natural environment. As with bacteria and antibiotic resistance, so fungi can evolve to become resistant to the drugs used to treat them. The second UN-hosted meeting on antimicrobial resistance took place on September 26, 2024. Aside from the wider acknowledgement of antimicrobial resistance, the meeting drew attention to the growing problem of fungal pathogens and their resistance to known treatments, globally. Tons of fungicides are used annually to protect crops, of which some work the same way as antifungals used in humans. An example of this is an antifungal drug class called the azoles.

Water samples taken showed a high concentration of a microalga not visible to the naked eye called Ostreopsis. No serious cases were observed out of the 674 cases reported to the authorities in Bordeaux. Climate change and human activities are causing changes in the marine environment.

As a result, they are the leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised and critically ill patients worldwide, who are most at risk. The food chain is one of the main drivers of MDR transmission, as food is not sterile and can usually have microbiological contamination or become contaminated at certain stages of the food chain (i.e. cross-contamination, recontamination). Indeed, the food chain can act as a driver for MDR spread, enabling the survival or even multiplication of MDR pathogens. MDR transmission is not exclusive to foods of animal origin or fish; plant foods can also harbour MDR microorganisms, as vegetables can be contaminated during primary production by water contaminated with faecal material from wastewater from surrounding farms. In general, pathogens are not common in food and the main risk arises from the high prevalence of non-pathogenic microorganisms that can transfer AMR genes to other microbial species, including foodborne pathogens. It is well documented that genes encoding resistance are transferable between different bacteria in farm animals and also from them to bacteria in food and humans by horizontal gene transfer (i.e. transformation, conjugation and transduction).",False,2021-09-21T00:00:00,2024-09-23T06:55:38,2.0,17.0,[1650]

180,1,F-2022-336,Nano coating of foods,"There is currently a lot of investment in research to develop new types of food packaging and a trend towards sustainable and also edible forms of packaging. Edible packaging is usually made of sustainable, biodegradable material. On the one hand, this includes packaging such as yoghurt pots that can be eaten, but also edible coatings that are placed around the food. In Switzerland, edible coatings of fruits and some vegetables are permitted, e.g. beeswax (E 901) as a coating for apples. Provided that the substances are approved as food additives for the respective food. What is new is that more and more packaging or coating agents are now being developed in nano form. Depending on the application, these are nanofibres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions or even nanoencapsulations. A current example is the development of a nano-cellulose layer for fruits and vegetables, which is made from pomace (pressed out fruit and vegetable peels). The project is a collaboration between Lidl and researchers at EMPA. The reason for using nano-forms is manifold. Nano-form coatings allow thin edible layers on the food (about 5nm thickness). Coatings based on nanotechnology usually also allow better regulation of moisture in the food and better gas exchange for longer shelf life. In addition, nanocoatings can enable other functions such as the incorporation of so-called nanosensors in food, which indicate the spoilage of food (so-called ""smart packaging""). Various legal and health issues arise in the application. For example, in the case of the cellulose developed by EMPA, it is not clear whether the already approved coating agents (celluloses E 460-469) cover the newly developed cellulose or whether it would need a new approval. Secondly, there are questions about the toxicity of the nanoparticles through the consumption of the edible layers, which need to be carefully clarified before new nanoforms can be put on the market. A report by the RIVM in the Netherlands, for example, points out that specific risk assessments are needed for nanocellulose applications in the food sector, and that these might even have to be considered as novel foods. Retailers and Empa (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology) are researching protective cellulose coating for fruit and vegetable products. The innovative coating is made from so-called pomace (press residue) and in the future, is to be used for retailers' products. The innovative project can reduce packaging and avoid food waste. No fresh vegetables are to be used for the novel protective coating, only organic residues. At Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials lab, commissioned by a retailer, researchers developed a special protective cellulose layer that can be applied to fruit and vegetables within a year's time. The result: the coated fruits and vegetables stay significantly longer fresh. In tests, for example, the shelf life of bananas could be extended by more than a week.Other materials for alternative packaging and substitutes for plastics are being researched, including silk, for example.",True,2022-03-16T00:00:00,2024-09-05T10:59:16,1.0,30.0,[2004]

Humans can be infected by the fecal-oral route; most commonly via contaminated water or food treated with it (such as salads, berries, herbs, etc.). In 2017 and 2018, several outbreaks occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States. In each of these outbreaks, numerous people fell ill. As a result, various food products were withdrawn from the market. International companies have also been affected. The list of outbreaks is long and seems to have been increasing in recent years.",True,2018-12-17T00:00:00,2025-02-28T07:42:44,1.0,20.0,[2014]
291,1,F-2025-008, Bacillus velezensis and foodborne outbreak,"Bacillus velezensis, an aerobic and sporulating bacterium, is utilized in agriculture for its ability to control pests and promote root growth, but it has also been linked to a recent outbreak of illness traced to a bakery's cake. An investigation revealed that individuals who consumed the cake experienced symptoms consistent with spore-forming bacteria, and the presence of B. velezensis was confirmed through testing. Factors such as inadequate pH regulation, insufficient cooking times, and poor cleaning practices contributed to the bacteria's proliferation in the cakes. The study highlights the potential for B. velezensis to cause mild enteric symptoms while also emphasizing the importance of proper food safety measures to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.",False,2025-07-01T06:34:48,2025-07-01T10:53:23,1.0,4.0,[2104]
99,1,F-2021-139,Acinetobacter in foods,"Bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter have become a major problem in hospitals around the world because they often develop resistances to antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. A new study has now been able to find evidence of the same bacteria in food and food-producing animals. The study collected and analysed a wide variety of chicken, pork and beef meat samples from markets in Lima and Peru. Researchers found 12 Acinetobacter isolates from five different beef samples sold at two unrelated markets. However, it has to be mentioned that the Acinetobacter isolates found in this study had a low prevalence and were not multi-resistant. Raw meat thus appears to be a new potential source of infection for humans or a reservoir for Acinetobacter bacteria respectively.",True,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2024-09-05T16:26:11,1.0,32.0,[2334]
24,1,F-2019-044,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE, syn. FSME)","TBE or tick-borne encephalitis (encephalitis = inflammation of the brain) is an infectious disease caused by the TBE virus. The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick (Castor bean tick). This is the most significant way of transmitting the virus. An alimentary transmission by unpasteurised milk, or milk products from acutely infected goats or cattle was reported on and has been discussed repeatedly in the past. In Germany, two outbreaks, caused by alimentary transmissions, were detected in 2016 and 2017 respectively. TBE is a viral infection caused by one in three tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis).",True,2019-01-30T00:00:00,2025-08-14T08:15:48,1.0,44.0,[1711]
128,1,F-2022-275,Bioplastic as packaging material,"As the environmental impact of the growing tide of plastic in the oceans and on land becomes more apparent, scientists are scrambling to create alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. But it has proven tricky to make bioplastics that are cheap, strong, water-resistant and break down quickly when their use is over. The race for renewable plastics has led to bioplastics made from corn starch, sugar cane, potatoes, coffee grounds, food waste, algae and wood waste powder.",False,2022-01-07T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:17:32,2.0,3.0,[1844]
86,1,F-2019-126,Mercury in permafrost,"New studies reveal that permafrost is the largest natural source of mercury on Earth - with mercury levels twice as high as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. Climate warming threatens to melt this permafrost and gradually release mercury into the food chain. Mercury enters permafrost naturally, as part of the global mercury cycle, but also as a result of anthropogenic activities such as burning coal and petroleum. Once inorganic mercury is released, it can be converted by microbes into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Eating fish from mercury-contaminated water therefore often leads to damage to the central nervous system and birth defects in humans. Released mercury can also enter the atmosphere and thus be distributed to other parts of the world, where it usually settles in rivers, lakes and seas.",True,2019-11-18T00:00:00,2024-10-18T07:04:04,1.0,66.0,[1927]
