190,4,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2026-02-02T07:51:14,1.75,13.0,"[2084, 2706, 2344, 2536]"
116,3,F-2021-232,<em>Anisakis </em>spp.: a parasite with allergic potential,"The consumption of raw or undercooked fish poses a potential risk of contamination with <em>Anksakis spp.</em>, a parasitic helminth, that can cause anisakidosis in humans. Swiss legislation requires fish that is to be consumed raw must be subjected to a treatment that inactivates the larvae of <em>Anisakis</em>. However, the larvae, even when dead, pose an allergenic risk to some consumers. Allergic and anaphylactic symptoms have been observed with increasing frequency, even after eating well-cooked fish. There is now evidence that the digestion of material from dead parasites in food also poses a risk (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224415301503"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">J.

238,2,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are <strong>three major areas of consideration</strong> where caution is needed regarding the use of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) in food production. These are : <strong>bias and discriminations</strong> linked to the data used, <strong>privacy and security</strong>, and finally how AI-led world would <strong>impact people's lives</strong>.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-11-10T08:35:26,1.0,68.0,"[2430, 2075]"

Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,10.0,[2042]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. <a href=""https://www.tagblatt.ch/wirtschaft/das-ist-die-protein-pflanze-der-zukunft-thurgauer-unternehmer-ueber-den-wunderbaum-mit-potenzial-ld.1215367"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Interview in the Tagblatt</a>.

58,1,F-2021-097,Food platforms and delivery services,"What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., <a href=""https://www.smood.ch/en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">smood.ch</a>). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., <a href=""https://de.eatwith.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">de.eatwith.com</a>); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., <a href=""https://www.deinkoch.ch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">deinkoch.ch</a>). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a <a href=""https://www.business-punk.com/2019/01/verpackungsfreier-lieferservice/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">packaging-free delivery service </a>as soon as autumn 2019.",True,2021-06-29T00:00:00,2025-07-25T07:10:30,1.0,13.0,[2242]
