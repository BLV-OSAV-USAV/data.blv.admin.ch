238,2,F-2023-021,"The use of AI in nutrition, food production and food safety","The Global Food and Retail Managing director of British Standards International stressed during a Forum that there are three major areas of consideration where caution is needed regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in food production. These are : bias and discriminations linked to the data used, privacy and security, and finally how AI-led world would impact people's lives.",False,2023-07-12T06:56:16,2025-04-02T07:52:27,1.5,61,"[1472, 2075]"
140,1,F-2021-287,Human gut microbiome,"The human gut microbiome is a diversified, resilient, immunostabilised, metabolically active and physiologically essential component of the human body. Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).",True,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2025-05-26T11:50:21,2.0,33,[1833]
190,1,F-2022-346,Tick-borne meat allergy,"Meat allergy was first observed in the 1990s and formally described in 2009, which makes it a relatively recent arrival to the compendium of allergic conditions. Its most curious quality may be that it is seemingly triggered by a tick bite. In America, the culprit, called the lone-star tick, females have a distinctive white splotch on their backs, is common in the warm and humid Southeast, where most cases of meat allergy have been diagnosed.This syndrome is called AlphaGal syndrome (AGS). Individuals are allergic to a sugar molecule, which does not occur in humans but is on a large number of cells in all other mammals. It is a sugar with the name galactose-alpha-1,3 galaktose, or alpha-galactose, or alpha-gal for short. AGS patients develop a disease after eating mammalian meat, dairy products or even cosmetics containing animal ingredients. Allergy symptoms: from thick lips, shortness of breath and itchy skin to circulatory problems and unconsciousness. Many suffer from abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea.",False,2022-05-09T00:00:00,2025-03-27T07:32:16,1.0,8,[2084]
147,1,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,10,[2042]
58,1,F-2021-097,Food platforms and delivery services,"What has found its way into other domains is also spreading in the food sector. Platforms offer consumers the possibility of having their food delivered and ready-to-eat by the restaurant of their choice, whereby different people in the same household can have a wide variety of dishes delivered to their home at the same time (e.g., smood.ch). Another option is to go eat at someone's place who offers their services on an internet platform (e.g., de.eatwith.com); yet another option is to have someone cook for you at home (e.g., deinkoch.ch). There are numerous delivery platforms, such as: Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Blue Apron, Amazon restaurants, GrubHub, Eat street, just eat, etc. In contrast to already existing offers, 'ghost kitchens' are establishing themselves, which uniquely produce on an industrial scale for delivery services and deliver to customers. A dining room with guests is no longer needed. Production and delivery can be industrialised using robots and drones. Bank analysts assume that there is great growth potential. Some providers go even further, they try to no longer use packaging materials. The German app Vanilla Bean, for example, plans to launch a packaging-free delivery service as soon as autumn 2019.",True,2021-06-29T00:00:00,2023-12-05T09:36:57,1.0,11,[1950]
128,1,F-2022-275,Bioplastic as packaging material,"As the environmental impact of the growing tide of plastic in the oceans and on land becomes more apparent, scientists are scrambling to create alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. But it has proven tricky to make bioplastics that are cheap, strong, water-resistant and break down quickly when their use is over. The race for renewable plastics has led to bioplastics made from corn starch, sugar cane, potatoes, coffee grounds, food waste, algae and wood waste powder.",False,2022-01-07T00:00:00,2022-09-06T13:17:32,2.0,3,[1844]
