118,1,F-2020-236,Listeria monocytogenes Serovar 4h - hypervirulent,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that comprises 14 serotypes, of which serovar 4h is a novel serotype recently reported. Serovar 4h L. monocytogenes belonging to hybrid sub-lineage II exhibit hypervirulent features. L. monocytogenes is one of the deadliest foodborne pathogens known and there is presently concern that foodborne outbreaks are increasingly caused by hypervirulent isolates. The isolates described by Yin et al. (2019) are unique in several ways: (i) they are unable to ferment rhamnose that is one of the four identifying biochemical features of Lm, (ii) they exhibit a CAMP-positive phenotype, typically only seen with the species L. ivanovii, (iii) they possess distinct anionic surface structures defining the serotype 4h, (iv) they are the only known Lm to carry genomic segments characteristic of another species, viz., L. ivanovii, and (v) they are the most virulent representatives of this species known today.",False,2020-12-22T00:00:00,2022-09-12T16:08:04,1.0,4.0,[2013]
232,1,F-2023-015,Persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in food environments,Specific Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) genotypes are adapted to meat and dairy processing environments. Genome analysis identified slaughterhouse as a Lm contamination source for meat processing facilities. Several events of Lm persistence over four years were identified in food processing facilities in Italy. Persistence seems not to be related to specific Lm genotypes.,False,2023-03-10T08:20:25,2025-02-24T07:25:43,1.0,37.0,[2013]
120,1,F-2021-238,Listeria monocytogenes serotyp 4b ST6 in cheese,"An outbreak of human listeriosis in Switzerland was attributed to persistent environmental contamination of a cheese factory with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b, sequence type 6, cluster type 7488. Whole genome sequencing was used to match clinical isolates with a cheese sample and with samples from numerous sites within the production environment.",False,2021-01-04T00:00:00,2024-10-17T06:54:42,1.0,11.0,[2013]
