87,1,F-2019-127,Cyanide in foods,"Bitter apricot kernels, flax seeds, and cassava contain cyanogenic glycosides in comparatively high concentrations as natural plant constituents. Cyanide is released by the enzyme ss-glucosidase, which is also contained in the plants, when they are eaten. After ingestion of a correspondingly high dose, cyanides can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy production.Bitter apricot kernels are of particular concern as they can lead to poisoning even in small amounts.The consumption of flax seeds is harmless to health if the common consumption recommendations of up to 15 g per meal are adhered to. According to the BfR (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices), there is no cyanide risk when eating marzipan and persipan.",False,2019-11-19T00:00:00,2022-09-01T15:36:30,1.0,3,[2636]
