27,1,F-2019-047,Dietary supplements,"According to Menu CH, around 50% of Swiss people regularly consume food supplements containing vitamins, minerals, trace elements or other substances. The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed. Consumers do not necessarily consult a doctor or a poison control centre, and there is no nutrivigilance system in Switzerland.Legal framework Switzerland: Most important: General food law provisions on safety and protection against deception, VNem, Ordinance on Novel Food, certain plants and substances may not be used in food (VLpH and VZVM). No nutrivigilance system (unlike France), no notification legal framework EU: Largely non-harmonised. Certain countries have specific regulations (maximum quantities, plant lists), some notification, few countries with nutrivigilance systems.",True,2019-02-11T00:00:00,2024-06-11T07:55:09,1.0,18,[2487]
