174,1,F-2021-326,Does palm oil promote the spread of cancer?,"Palm oil is obtained from the pulp of the palm fruit. The fruits are sterilised and pressed, resulting in the crude palm oil, CPO (Crude Palm Oil). Due to their high carotene content, fruits and oil have an orange-yellow to brown-red colour, which is removed during refining. Pure and fresh palm oil has a specific violet smell, a sweetish, pleasant taste and is clear and light in colour. Commercial oil, however, is usually cloudy and coloured due to less carefully executed preparation methods. The oil also becomes increasingly cloudy and has a more intense odour as it ages (Wikipedia). Fatty acid found in palm oil has been linked to the spread of cancer. Given that palm oil is in frequently used in our foods, this is a worrying report. The palmitic acid found in palm oil alters the genes of cancer cells and increases the likelihood of metastases forming.",False,2021-11-22T00:00:00,2022-09-19T09:18:26,1.0,3,[2326]
