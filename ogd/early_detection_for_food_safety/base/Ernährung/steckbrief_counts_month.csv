233,1,F-2023-016,Social media and food safety risk,"Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.",True,2023-03-13T13:01:19,2024-11-14T07:59:57,1.0,48,[1815]
95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2024-11-18T13:33:51,1.0,70,[1791]
263,1,F-2024-011,"Salmonella Infantis, an emerging human multidrug-resistant pathogen","Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis is a concerning human pathogen due to its widespread presence and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. A study analyzing strains from 74 countries found that a high percentage of poultry isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, attributed to the presence of the pESI megaplasmid. This highlights the potential for transmission of multidrug-resistant strains from poultry to humans, emphasizing the need for surveillance and control measures.",False,2024-03-14T08:26:04,2024-03-15T10:20:57,1.0,4,[1794]
115,1,F-2021-231,Salmonella Napoli - seasonality,"Individual cases salmonellosis, spread throughout Switzerland and attributable to a specific salmonella species, were frequent in 2019. However, the occurrence of S. Napoli is particularly striking. The cases that have been occurring since 2002 show a seasonal pattern. The weekly threshold defined by the FOPH was exceeded in 2019, triggering investigations which, however, did not reveal any indication of a possible cause of the illness mentioned above. At present, there are no indications of sources or causes of infection. According to literature studies, the pathogen occurs conspicuously often on rocket. However, further investigations also show an association with surface water. Water could thus be a central source, whether as irrigation water for salads and vegetables or as water associated with leisure activities (bathing, swimming, paddling, etc.). Animal products, on the other hand, seem to be of secondary importance. In contrast to other Salmonella serovars, this pathogen seems to cause more invasive diseases in addition to gastrointestinal diseases.",True,2021-05-18T00:00:00,2024-02-26T11:08:34,1.0,34,[1794]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.",True,2019-05-27T00:00:00,2024-09-17T06:30:10,1.0,108,[1809]
