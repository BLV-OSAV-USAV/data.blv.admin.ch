95,5,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-06-20T06:27:38,1.0,80.0,"[2199, 2223, 2217, 2224, 2197]"
233,1,F-2023-016,Social media and food safety risk,"Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.",True,2023-03-13T13:01:19,2025-02-12T07:11:17,1.0,50.0,[2192]
