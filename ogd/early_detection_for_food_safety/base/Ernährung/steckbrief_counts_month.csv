95,2,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-03-31T07:34:09,1.5,76,"[2147, 2141]"
147,2,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,10,"[2137, 2139]"
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42,[2154]
