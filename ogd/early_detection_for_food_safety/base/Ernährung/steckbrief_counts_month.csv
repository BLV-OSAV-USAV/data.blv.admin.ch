87,1,F-2019-127,Cyanide in foods,"Bitter apricot kernels, flax seeds, and cassava contain cyanogenic glycosides in comparatively high concentrations as natural plant constituents. Cyanide is released by the enzyme ss-glucosidase, which is also contained in the plants, when they are eaten. After ingestion of a correspondingly high dose, cyanides can lead to acute poisoning by blocking energy production.Bitter apricot kernels are of particular concern as they can lead to poisoning even in small amounts.The consumption of flax seeds is harmless to health if the common consumption recommendations of up to 15 g per meal are adhered to. According to the BfR (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices), there is no cyanide risk when eating marzipan and persipan.",False,2019-11-19T00:00:00,2022-09-01T15:36:30,1.0,3.0,[2636]
95,1,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,87.0,[2590]
