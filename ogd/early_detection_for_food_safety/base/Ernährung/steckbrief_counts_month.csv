95,3,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-01-31T10:00:34,1.0,73.0,"[1978, 1969, 2001]"
147,2,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,9.0,"[1978, 1997]"
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021.Â Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,42.0,[1983]
