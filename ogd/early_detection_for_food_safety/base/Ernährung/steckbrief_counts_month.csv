95,3,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-01-31T10:00:34,1.0,73.0,"[1978, 1969, 2001]"
147,2,F-2021-295,Plant-based substitutes - nutrients,"Milk is the main source of iodine in the UK; however, the consumption and popularity of plant-based milk alternatives is increasing. Consumers may be at risk of iodine deficiency as milk alternatives, unless fortified, have low iodine concentrations.Agroscope has also conducted a study on the nutritional quality of plant-based beverages. This revealed major differences in macro- and micronutrient composition compared to cow's milk. Many of the milk alternatives are therefore fortified with micronutrients.",False,2021-07-20T00:00:00,2024-02-26T08:33:16,1.0,9.0,"[1978, 1997]"
36,1,F-2019-056,Climate change and its impact on food safety,"Climate change is likely to have a considerable impact on food safety, both direct and indirect, putting public health at risk. With changing rainfall patterns and increases in extreme weather conditions and the annual average temperature, we will begin to face the impacts of climate change. These impacts will affect the persistence and occurrence of bacteria, viruses, parasites, harmful algae, fungi and their vectors, and the patterns of their corresponding food-borne diseases and risk of toxic contamination. Alongside these impacts, chemical residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines in plant and animal products will be affected by changes in pest pressure. The risk of food contamination with heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants following changes in crop varieties cultivated, cultivation methods, soils, redistribution of sediments and long-range atmospheric transport, is increased because of climate change. Climate-sensitive risk factors and illnesses will be among the largest contributors to the global burden of food-related disease and mortality, including malnutrition, communicable, non-communicable, and diarrheal- and vector-borne diseases.",False,2019-03-05T00:00:00,2024-12-06T07:48:44,1.0,42.0,[1925]
233,1,F-2023-016,Social media and food safety risk,"Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social networks. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or accredited experts from the scientific community to connect with customers and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users. The use of social media can be both a threat and an opportunity for public health.",True,2023-03-13T13:01:19,2025-02-12T07:11:17,1.0,50.0,[1935]
211,1,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021.Â Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources. It shows that such products may be contaminated with pathogens on the market or have led to outbreaks. At present, there are hardly any results from microbiological analyses (monitoring ring data) of such products.",False,2022-10-10T08:40:39,2025-01-31T07:19:58,1.0,42.0,[1983]
