95,3,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-08-11T08:31:58,1.0,85.0,"[2347, 2354, 2298]"
174,1,F-2021-326,Does palm oil promote the spread of cancer?,"Palm oil is obtained from the pulp of the palm fruit. The fruits are sterilised and pressed, resulting in the crude palm oil, CPO (Crude Palm Oil). Due to their high carotene content, fruits and oil have an orange-yellow to brown-red colour, which is removed during refining. Pure and fresh palm oil has a specific violet smell, a sweetish, pleasant taste and is clear and light in colour. Commercial oil, however, is usually cloudy and coloured due to less carefully executed preparation methods. The oil also becomes increasingly cloudy and has a more intense odour as it ages (Wikipedia). Fatty acid found in palm oil has been linked to the spread of cancer. Given that palm oil is in frequently used in our foods, this is a worrying report. The palmitic acid found in palm oil alters the genes of cancer cells and increases the likelihood of metastases forming.",False,2021-11-22T00:00:00,2022-09-19T09:18:26,1.0,3.0,[2326]
148,1,F-2021-296,Food supplements - Nootropics,"The category of performance-enhancing food supplements has undergone a significant change in the last ten years. For a long time, the market was dominated by products that were intended to increase athletic performance (e.g. through building muscle).In recent years, however, another market segment has established itself, that of so-called nootropics (substances with an effect on the central nervous system). These nutraceuticals (traditional/herbal remedies, food supplements, functional food) focus on increasing cognitive performance. Thus, physical and, above all, mental performance is to be increased by these products.",False,2021-06-21T00:00:00,2022-09-15T11:39:44,1.0,3.0,[2299]
