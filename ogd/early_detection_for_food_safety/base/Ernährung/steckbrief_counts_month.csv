95,2,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods. Maximum permitted levels for food additives and contaminants are set to protect consumers, but their cumulative effects are largely unknown.",False,2020-01-06T00:00:00,2025-03-31T07:34:09,1.0,76.0,"[2105, 2059]"
273,1,F-2024-021,Microdosing candies,"The Food and Drug Administration is investigating nearly 50 illnesses—including one possible death—that might be linked to microdosing candies available online and at retailers nationwide. These chocolate bars and gummies showed higher than normal amounts of muscimol, a chemical found in mushrooms of the genus amanita, wich could be a potential cause of symptoms consistent with those observed in persons who became ill after eating the products",True,2024-07-04T08:58:03,2025-01-09T08:32:27,1.0,20.0,[2070]
51,1,F-2019-083,Surrogate meat and meat alternatives,"The consumption of meat is coming under heightened pressure, be that for religious, environmental or health reasons. Numerous publications have appeared on this topic. But what does this mean in terms of opportunities and risks in terms of food safety?Alternative protein sources, mostly not animal-based, are an upward trend. Increasing interest in vegetarian or vegan diets is only one reason for this development, concerns about the environmental and climate impacts of animal agriculture, as well as the question of how to feed a growing world population in the future, also support the search for alternative protein sources. Here are some examples: Moringa tree: a Thurgau-based company wants to extract protein from the leaves of the Moringa tree and use it for the food and feed industry. Interview in the Tagblatt. (April 2020). Algae directly consumed and processed. Insects directly consumed and processed. Fermentation: see ADURA ID 129 'Animal-free food'.",True,2019-05-27T00:00:00,2025-03-07T07:40:51,1.0,112.0,[2043]
