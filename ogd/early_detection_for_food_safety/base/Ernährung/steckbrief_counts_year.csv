95,31,F-2020-135,Ultraprocessed food,"Since 1980, scientific literature has reported on the links between the prevalence of certain health conditions and the high consumption of ultra-processed food (see NOVA Klassifikation for definition of ultraprocessed food). The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced. Additives are often used to improve shelf life and taste, and chemical contaminants can result from processing methods.

Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, use social media platforms to attract attention with compelling narratives, build an audience and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users.

211,6,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found. Banach et al. (2022) provide a general overview of potential hazards of alternative proteins for milk substitutes, based on the different protein sources.

140,6,F-2021-287,Human gut microbiome,"The human gut microbiome is a diversified, resilient, immunostabilised, metabolically active and physiologically essential component of the human body. Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).",True,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2024-12-23T07:17:40,1.5,32.0,"[1841, 1833, 1849, 1459, 1458, 1321]"

With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more ""high protein"" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this ""high protein"" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the ""healthy"" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of ""if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt"".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite ""high protein"" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly.  In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.",True,2023-01-27T13:00:59,2024-07-29T06:48:44,1.25,18.0,"[1486, 1157, 1224, 1917]"

The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed.

150,3,F-2022-298,Artificial sweeteners influence microbiome,"New research shows that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become sick and invade the gastrointestinal wall, potentially leading to serious health problems. The study by Shil and Chichger (2021) , published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, is the first to show the pathogenic effects of some of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose and aspartame, on two types of gut bacteria, E. coli (Escherichia coli) and E. faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis). Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by scientists at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), has shown that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. It was found that these pathogenic bacteria can attach to, invade, and kill Caco-2 cells, the epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal wall. It is known that bacteria such as E. faecalis that cross the intestinal wall can enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, causing a range of infections including septicaemia. In this new study, it was found that at concentrations equivalent to two cans of diet soft drink, all three artificial sweeteners significantly increased the adhesion of E. coli and E. faecalis to intestinal Caco-2 cells and differentially increased the formation of biofilms (Eurek Alert).The substance D-allulose belongs to the group of simple sugars (monosaccharides).The specific risk of favouring human pathogenic bacteria in the human body by food ingredients is to be considered as a possible ""emerging risk"". Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been repeatedly criticised for not being safe. This thesis has been taken up in various studies and examined by means of meta-analyses. The authors Millstone and Dawson conclude that it is premature to call aspartame 'safe' because the studies conducted by the EFSA to assess aspartame are flawed.Concerns are also raised concerning the sweetener D-allulose. The sweetness of D-allulose corresponds to about 70% of the sweeteness of household sugar (sucrose), but leads to a significantly lower calorie intake, which is why the substance is advertised as a sugar substitute. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has yet to issue an opinion on the safety of D-allulose as a novel food. The BfR (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) reported that the use of D-allulose as a food ingredient could selectively promote the growth of bacteria of the Klebsiella genus, such as K. pneumoniae, in the human body. From a risk assessment perspective, the extent to which regular consumption of previously uncommon amounts of D-allulose as a novel food will undesirably influence the occurrence of Klebsiella spp. in the human gut microbiome remains to be scientifically determined.",True,2022-05-31T00:00:00,2024-11-18T08:39:33,1.33,28.0,"[1522, 1273, 1251]"

While neotame has been shown to change the profile of gut bacteria, very little research has investigated the effect of neotame at the cellular level.",False,2024-04-29T09:10:02,2024-04-30T06:58:35,2.0,4.0,[1251]
137,1,F-2021-284,Fish oil as a food supplement,"Currently, fish oil supplements are indicated for patients with elevated plasma triglycerides to reduce cardiovascular risk. Due to the high prevalence of elevated triglycerides in the population, they can be prescribed frequently. It is worth noting that low-dose omega-3 fatty acids are available over the counter. Some clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. People with this disorder are five times more likely to have a stroke. Lombardi et al (2021) found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared to placebo, with an incidence rate of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.54; p<0.001).",False,2021-05-12T00:00:00,2022-09-12T11:03:19,1.0,4.0,[1727]

174,1,F-2021-326,Does palm oil promote the spread of cancer?,"Palm oil is obtained from the pulp of the palm fruit. The fruits are sterilised and pressed, resulting in the crude palm oil, CPO (Crude Palm Oil). Due to their high carotene content, fruits and oil have an orange-yellow to brown-red colour, which is removed during refining. Pure and fresh palm oil has a specific violet smell, a sweetish, pleasant taste and is clear and light in colour. Commercial oil, however, is usually cloudy and coloured due to less carefully executed preparation methods. The oil also becomes increasingly cloudy and has a more intense odour as it ages (Wikipedia). Fatty acid found in palm oil has been linked to the spread of cancer. Given that palm oil is in frequently used in our foods, this is a worrying report. The palmitic acid found in palm oil alters the genes of cancer cells and increases the likelihood of metastases forming.",False,2021-11-22T00:00:00,2022-09-19T09:18:26,1.0,3.0,[1426]
32,1,F-2019-052,Bovine meat and milk factors (BMMF),"There are reports in the media about a new, possibly infection-causing structure, called BMMF (ring-shaped genetic elements, similar to the plasmids of bacteria). However, the nature of the postulated pathogens, which lie between viruses and bacteria, does not seem to be clear yet. The German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) reports: the distribution pattern of new colorectal and breast cancer cases observed worldwide suggests a close connection between the consumption of milk and meat products from European cattle (Bos taurus).The hypothesis is: an infection with a previously unknown pathogen transmitted by consuming dairy products and/or beef occurs in early infancy. The pathogens induce a chronic inflammatory reaction in certain tissues (intestine, breast), which can promote the development of cancer in the surrounding tissue. The outbreak of the disease occurs decades after the infection! Possible causative agents could be the BMMFs, single-stranded ring-shaped DNA elements that show great similarity to sequences of specific bacterial plasmids. Most BMMFs show similarity to plasmids of Acinetobacter baumannii. Some BMMFs also show similarities to certain viruses with small, circular, single-stranded DNA genomes. The nature of these pathogens has not yet been clearly defined. They represent a new class of pathogens that are, in their characteristics, between viruses and bacteria. Therefore, in view of the relationship to plasmids, the name ""plasmidomes"" was chosen for this previously unknown class of pathogens.",False,2019-02-27T00:00:00,2023-12-21T14:52:42,2.0,7.0,[1919]
239,1,F-2023-022,Helicobacter pylori in raw and ready-to-eat meat,"Helicobacter pylori, classified as a class-I carcinogen, is one of the leading medical pathogens of global concern associated mainly with the development of gastric adenocarcinomas and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas; nevertheless, its prevalence in food especially meat and meat products is not fully covered. A study investigated the prevalence, molecular characterization, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of clarithromycin-, and metronidazole-resistant H. pylori isolated from raw and ready-to-eat meat samples retailed in Mansoura city, Egypt. The results showed a widespread contamination of examined raw and ready-to-eat meat product samples with multidrug-resistant H. pylori isolates, which could constitute a tremendous public health hazard.",True,2023-07-26T11:34:05,2024-10-22T07:57:08,1.0,33.0,[1270]
59,1,F-2019-098,Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) (e.g Vertical Farming),"A new trend is spreading. Salads and herbs are growing directly in retail shops. Young plants are grown hors-sol in illuminated display cases. The customer harvests them himself. The concept of underground farming goes even further. Here, fish and vegetables are grown in underground, disused caverns, tunnels and underground shafts in a circular economy. This concept also aims to use less water and fewer pesticides. The first underground farm is already growing and selling salads in London.Vertical farming can play an important role in reducing emissions from the agricultural sector while providing affordable and abundant food to consumers. Vertical farming can produce high crop yield.Artificial grow lights, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent grow lights, are commonly used in modern day indoor farming, citing advantages in energy efficiency and a higher controlled environment. However, the use of LEDs poses a risk in mercury contaminations as a result of its production process, specifically LEDs with polyurethane encapsulates that were traditionally produced using mercury resins as a catalyst. The investigation found high concentrations of mercury in the LED encapsulant, and the encapsulant material was identified to be polyurethane, indicating the source of mercury contamination to be the LED polyurethane encapsulant.",True,2019-07-30T00:00:00,2025-02-13T06:40:03,2.0,51.0,[1386]
