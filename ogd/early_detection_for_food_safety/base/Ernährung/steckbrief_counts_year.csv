The increased consumption of this type of food may be responsible for the increase in incidence of many health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, loss of microbial diversity, dysbiosis, other inflammation-related diseases of the digestive system, increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease and cancer. Ultra-processed foods have high energy density (energy per volume) and low nutrient density (nutrient per unit energy), making them nutritionally unbalanced.

This can result in the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines the proper functioning of democracy, but also diminishes support for science-based or evidence-based policies. In addition, ephemeral types of content that attract the attention of a large audience (trends) can quickly spread across major social media platforms and be replicated by more or less aware users.

211,3,F-2022-367,Surrogate dairy products,"Vegan nutrition is very much in vogue. Companies are responding to this trend by developing new milk substitutes to replace drinking milk, butter and cheese. To date, there are various milk substitutes with very different compositions. The impact on food safety of foods derived from plants depends on the soil, the agricultural inputs used to grow the source plants, but also on how the plants are harvested, stored, transported and processed. The process engineering methods used to treat and process the proteins are then decisive (FAO, 2021). Plant-based dairy products generally have a greater variety of ingredients than animal products and therefore potentially offer a wide range of sources from which hazards can arise. Compared to dairy products, dairy substitutes occupy a niche position. However, according to the FOAG, their market share in the retail trade is steadily increasing, from 2.7 per cent in 2017 to 4.2 per cent in 2021. Although there are numerous products on the market, only generic approaches for risk assessment of such products can be found.

The focus of this briefing note is primarily on food supplements containing plant extracts or endogenous substances (amino acids, coenzymes, etc.) in concentrated doses, which are notyet specifically regulated in Switzerland (see legal framework). Food supplements are foods and as such must be safe and not deceptive, they must also not be pharmacologically active. This responsibility primarily lies with the manufacturers/distributors within the framework of their self-regulation. As they are available as capsules, pills, powder, etc., the presentation of food supplements is similar to that of drugs; more concretely, they are sometimes advertised similarly to drugs namely, as improving health/quality of life or are at least perceived as such by consumers. On the internet, but also in supermarkets and health food shops, products are also offered as food supplements which are to be classified as non-approved novel foods or drugs. Novel foods and medicinal products undergo an official approval procedure in which their safety to health must be proven before they can be marketed. For the other food supplements, which are not considered novel foods, no approval procedure is required. Practice shows that the specifications of such products are often unclear and the toxicity (main substance, residual extracts, contaminants) is not clarified by experts. In literature, through nutrivigilance systems and through official warnings (e.g., from the US FDA), case studies of adverse effects, of up to serious liver or kidney damage are described (e.g., with certain green tea extracts), or also interactions with drugs taken simultaneously. The number of undesirable effects that go unnoticed is estimated to be high; as the effects are often not immediately visible and thus the causal connection to previous consumption goes unnoticed.

140,1,F-2021-287,Human gut microbiome,"The human gut microbiome is a diversified, resilient, immunostabilised, metabolically active and physiologically essential component of the human body. Scientific investigations have been conducted to explore detailed information on the establishment of the human gut microbiome, the functioning of the microbiome, the succession of the microbiome, factors influencing microbial community dynamics and the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease. Extensive research has suggested microbiome therapeutics as a futuristic medicine for various physiological and metabolic disorders. A comprehensive review of microbial colonisation, host-microbe interactions, microbial adaptation, commensal selection and immune survivability is still required to catalogue the essential genetic and physiological features for commensal engagement. The evolution of a structured human gut microbiome relies on microbial flexibility for genetic, immunological and physiological adaptation in the human gut. The key features for commensalism could be used in the development of a tailored microbiome-based therapy to overcome various physiological and metabolic disorders.The influence of the gut microbiome on human health has come increasingly into focus in recent years. The microbiome in the gut has an important function in the metabolism of food components and chemicals and also serves as a barrier against harmful effects from the environment. The microbiome is a highly diverse community of microorganisms and includes bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. Ongoing studies show that microbiome structure and dynamics can have both a direct (e.g., direct metabolic conversion of chemicals) and indirect (e.g., regulation of gut barrier function) impact on human and animal health. The microbiome structure and dynamics are in turn influenced by external influences, such as food or chemicals. There are now a number of studies showing an effect of additives such as artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers on the microbiome, often resulting in impaired glucose metabolism or gut inflammation (Laudisi et al. 2019, Roca-Saavedra et al. 2018). There is evidence from studies with mice that emulsifiers, for example, can disrupt gut homeostasis and lead to inflammation in the gut (Chassaing et al. 2015). Recent data also show that artificial sweeteners favour horizontal gene transfer in intestinal bacteria and thus promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (Yu et al. 2021).",True,2021-11-16T00:00:00,2025-05-26T11:50:21,1.0,34.0,[2439]
222,1,F-2023-005,Protein supplements : effects of a (too) high protein diet,"""A high protein intake is great for losing weight, but it's also great for athletes."" With such and similar statements, the importance of proteins in the diet is advertised. At the same time, more and more ""high protein"" foods are available, which - as the name suggests - have a higher protein content than their conventional counterparts. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body. But what are the consequences if the recommended daily intake is chronically exceeded? People who follow this ""high protein"" trend are particularly affected.A chronic excess of protein can have negative consequences in the long term. However, these health risks are only discussed in the specialist literature; the general population is insufficiently informed about them. On the contrary, protein-enriched products are now widely available in shops, and big advertising campaigns by the industry promise health benefits thanks to these (expensive) trendy products. The lack of information about the possible negative effects of too much protein gives the false impression that the ""healthy"" amount of protein is unlimited, in the sense of ""if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt"".Delimaris et al. (2013) conclude in their article that extra protein is not efficiently utilised by the body and can put a strain on the metabolism of bones, kidneys and liver. According to the authors, there is currently no reasonable scientific basis in the literature for recommending consumption above the RDA for healthy adults (= recommended daily allowance). Disorders of bone and calcium homeostasis, disorders of kidney function, increased risk of cancer, disorders of liver function and accelerated progression of coronary heart disease are mentioned as health risks associated with long-term intake of (too) much protein in humans. Barzel et al. (1998) also describe the effect of over-acidification of the body through excessive protein intake and the associated compensation through bone loss and thus calcium loss.In connection with protein diets for weight reduction, St. Jeor et al. (2001) write that there are no scientific long-term studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of such diets. High-protein diets even prevent the necessary requirements of important vitamins and minerals from being met due to the restriction of certain groups of nutrients. LM groups. Furthermore, there is a general risk - despite ""high protein"" - of a deficiency of essential amino acids if the biological value of the proteins is not taken into account and the foods are combined accordingly.  In summary, the excessive intake of proteins does not represent an acute danger for the Swiss population, but long-term damage is to be expected.",True,2023-01-27T13:00:59,2025-09-16T07:10:35,1.0,24.0,[2478]

236,1,F-2023-019,Antimicrobial resistance genes in probiotic bacteria,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to public health. In bacteria, AMR depends on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), some of which are mobile and can transfer their ARGs to other bacteria. This action, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involves the transfer of small fragments of DNA between bacteria and is facilitated by plasmids, among other things. If bacteria with mobile ARGs are found in food, they can transmit these ARGs to bacteria in the human digestive tract or to pathogens when ingested, contributing to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Although the extent to which probiotics modulate the microbiome is disputed, it is possible that they contribute to the intestinal resistome by colonising the gut. A recent study conducted in Europe, analysing in detail probiotic bacterial species commonly used in certain foods (fermented and non-fermented) and dietary supplements, suggests that consumption of certain probiotic bacterial strains could contribute to the onset and spread of AMR, as in more than half of AGR-positive samples, at least one gene is linked to a plasmid. The results are consistent with another study concluding that the consumption of probiotic products can lead to the transfer of AGRs to human intestinal bacteria. Similarly, probiotics used to feed livestock can also cause antibiotic-resistant THG in animals. Animals treated with these resistant probiotics are likely to become a possible source of ARG for human consumers after ingestion of meat or dairy products.",True,2023-05-02T10:47:28,2025-10-09T09:07:44,1.0,20.0,[2118]

It can also determine the response to cancer therapies and predict disease progression and survival (Jain et al., 2021). There is vast literature on the beneficial effects of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A review of the available literature on the subject was published in 2022. The authors conclude that probiotics have been shown to be effective against various types of cancer, but also that there is a need to evaluate the adverse effects of probiotics (gastrointestinal side effects, skin reactions, access to antibiotic resistance genes, harmful effects of metabolites, abnormal stimulation of the immune system) (Sankarapandian et al., 2022). Cancer patients have compromised immunity due to primary disease, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The effects of probiotics in this population may differ from those in healthy individuals and raise several critical issues (Lu et al., 2021). A new publication states that Lactobacillus can alter the function of immune cells (macrophages) in the pancreatic tumour environment and stimulate cancer growth (Hezaveh et al., 2022). The mechanism involves the metabolisation of dietary tryptophan by bacteria in the gut, which leads to an inactivation of immune cells involved in tumour control. This is not the only indication of potentially harmful effects of probiotic microorganisms, even independently of the presence of cancer. Among others:

Although probiotic bacteria are generally recognised as safe (GRAS status), there are several reports of side effects triggered by the presence of these organisms: systemic infections, impact on the immune system, disruption of metabolism and horizontal gene transfer (Zawistowska-Rojek and Tyski, 2018).
Brain fog syndrome has been reported to be related to probiotic use, with symptoms improving with antibiotics and probiotic discontinuation (Rao et al., 2018).
